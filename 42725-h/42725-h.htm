<h1 title="">The Meadow-Brook Girls on the Tennis Courts</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br /><span class="small">SMOKE RINGS FROM THE HILLS</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I want thome exthitement,&rdquo; complained
Grace Thompson petulantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have patience, Tommy,&rdquo; answered
Jane McCarthy. &ldquo;Did you ever know the
Meadow-Brook Girls to go long without it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that we can look for anything
exciting up here on this side hill, surrounded by
stumps, burned trees and blackened logs,&rdquo; returned
Margery Brown. &ldquo;I shall just perish
from doing nothing. We have been up here
nearly two days and nothing has happened. I
should rather be down in the meadows than up
here in this dismal place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Elting, the guardian of the party of girls
encamped on the hillside, smiled tolerantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; suggested the towheaded
Tommy. &ldquo;Buthter, you are fat and
round. We&rsquo;ll thcrape off a thmooth plathe all
the way down the thide of the hill, then you roll
down to the bottom. That will give you exthitement
and make uth laugh, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But there is a jumping-off place at the bottom,&rdquo;
objected Margery. &ldquo;I should fall down
on the stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, I know. But that would be exthitement
and make uth laugh. Why thhould you be
fat, if it ithn&rsquo;t to make other folkth laugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery elevated her nose disdainfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it yourself,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tommy. You wish excitement. Suppose
you run down and jump into the creek at
the bottom of the hill,&rdquo; called Harriet Burrell,
raising a flushed face from the fire over which
she was cooking their supper. &ldquo;Run down and
jump in. If the water is deep, you might pretend
you are drowning; then Margery will rush to
your rescue and save you. Drowning is exciting
enough. I know, for I was nearly drowned
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear a little trout stream at the foot of a
hill would not prove very exciting to a girl who
has been lost at sea for hours on a dark night,&rdquo;
observed the guardian. &ldquo;You will have to think
of something else, Harriet. Are you, too, suffering
from inactivity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. Miss Elting,&rdquo; answered Harriet
brightly. &ldquo;I came out here with you for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_008">[008]</span>
sake of the outing, for the fresh air and the birds
and the odors of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Burned stumps,&rdquo; finished Margery. &ldquo;The
whole place smells like a country smoke-house,
where the farmer smokes his hams for the winter.
Ugh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as I am concerned,&rdquo; resumed Harriet
Burrell, &ldquo;I am not looking for excitement. I am
enjoying myself thoroughly. What is more,
were I looking for the unusual, I do not think it
would be necessary to look far for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy regarded her companion with narrowed
eyes and wrinkled forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know thomething that we don&rsquo;t
know, Harriet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I do and perhaps not,&rdquo; was the
evasive reply. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you use your eyes
and your ears and your nose, you and Margery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nose?&rdquo; sniffed Buster. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
trouble. This horrible, smoky, burned smell
makes me ill. When I shut my eyes I think
the side of the hill is on fire right this minute,
instead of a year or so ago, or whenever it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gazed first down the slope to the valley
below, where a slender stream was to be seen
threading its way through the blackened landscape,
then up the hill to where the trees had
begun to grow again after the forest fire had
<span class="pb" id="Page_009">[009]</span>
seared their leaves and blackened their young
trunks. The trees were making a noble fight for
life, the green at their tops showing that some
success had attended their unequal fight. Here
and there blackened slabs of granite protruded
from the uninviting landscape between the camp
of the young women and the denser forest beyond,
which the fire had failed to reach. Still
farther on the campers saw the road that led
back to their homes at Meadow-Brook.</p>
<p>The small tent, that had been packed in sections,
had already taken on something of the dispiriting
color of the landscape in which it had
been set. Within the tent the girls had leveled
off the ground as well as possible and dug deep
trenches on the uphill side, so that they might
not be drowned out in case of a heavy rainstorm.
They had chosen this uninviting spot
principally because it was different from any
place in which they had made camp during their
summer vacations of the past two years. They
could easily shift to another location were they
to tire of this one. One advantage of the present
site lay in the fact that it was removed from
human habitation by some miles. Their own
homes lay about twelve miles to the eastward.</p>
<p>Hazel Holland, the fifth girl of the Meadow-Brook
Girls&rsquo; party, also saw that Harriet had
something in mind. She walked over near the
<span class="pb" id="Page_010">[010]</span>
fire and sat down, regarding Harriet inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Harriet?&rdquo; she questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t said. Use your eyes. I am too
busy getting supper now to make any explanations.
Haven&rsquo;t you girls seen anything unusual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have,&rdquo; answered Margery. &ldquo;Everything
is unusual around here&mdash;too much so to
suit my cultivated tastes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ith thome mythtery here,&rdquo; observed
Tommy Thompson wisely.</p>
<p>Miss Elting asked no questions. She knew
that Harriet would speak of what was in her
mind when she was ready to do so. The supper
was soon cooked, the dishes set on a blanket,
which had been spread on a fairly level place.
Other blankets had been laid down on which the
girls took their places with their feet curled underneath
them. The dishes were mostly tin and
paper, but the supper, smoking and steaming on
the blanket, was savory and appetizing. The
girls forgot their dismal surroundings in the
pleasure of eating what Harriet Burrell had prepared
for them, though Margery did her best to
look sour, in order to hide her satisfaction, while
Tommy now and then regarded her with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Buthter intendth to thtop eating
<span class="pb" id="Page_011">[011]</span>
to-night,&rdquo; was the little lisping girl&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stop making remarks about me,&rdquo; exploded
Buster. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you I should go
right back home if you did it again this summer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buthter never liketh to hear the truth about
herthelf,&rdquo; averred Tommy with an impish grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth!&rdquo; exclaimed the now angry Margery.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never speak to you again, Grace
Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you girls only knew how silly you are, you
would reform,&rdquo; said Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only way for a fat perthon to reform
ith to run all day in the hot thun,&rdquo; answered
Tommy. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you try it, Buthter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery glared speechlessly at her tormentor,
but before she could frame a fitting reply
Hazel suddenly asked Harriet a question that
quickly changed the current of thought in the
minds of the two disputants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will tell us what you meant
when you made that remark a short time ago,
Harriet,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What remark, Hazel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About not having to look far for excitement,
about using our eyes, ears and noses,&rdquo; replied
Hazel. &ldquo;What did you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I said,&rdquo; repeated Harriet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_012">[012]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Be good enough to explain, pleathe?&rdquo; urged
Tommy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not clever at guething riddleth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you girls used your ears, you would
have heard something; had you used your eyes,
you would have seen smoke; had you used your
noses, you would have smelled smoke. Now do
you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, I underthtand,&rdquo; replied Tommy after
a brief interval of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you understand?&rdquo; demanded Margery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Harriet ith lothing her mind. Maybe
thhe&rsquo;ll find it under the blanketth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More likely to find a snake under there,&rdquo;
suggested Hazel, whereat there were screams
from Tommy and Buster, who sprang to their
feet, gazing at the ground with a frightened expression
in their eyes. &ldquo;Sit down if you wish
any more supper,&rdquo; urged Hazel, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wathn&rsquo;t funny in the leatht, Hathel,&rdquo;
declared Grace severely. &ldquo;Now tell uth truthfully,
Harriet, what you meant by hearing and
theeing and thmelling thingth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, I will draw you a map.&rdquo; Harriet
traced a square in the ashes with a stick, making
a round dot in the lower left-hand corner. &ldquo;This
dot is the camp of the Meadow-Brook Girls,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;At the extreme upper side are the
woods that you see over the brow of the hill, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_013">[013]</span>
these,&rdquo; making a series of rings, &ldquo;are smoke&mdash;smoke
rings. Well, why doesn&rsquo;t some one say
something?&rdquo; she chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke rings?&rdquo; questioned the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Elting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet Burrell waved one hand toward the
brow of the hill, giving the guardian a meaning
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we have neighbors,&rdquo; replied Harriet
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neighbors!&rdquo; screamed Margery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? who? what?&rdquo; asked the girls in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thave me! I thhould die of fright if I were
to thee a thtrange human being again,&rdquo; cried
Tommy. &ldquo;Do&mdash;do you think it ith a man, a real
live man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet Burrell nodded. Tommy&rsquo;s eyes grew
larger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is. Perhaps more than one. Listen.
I heard some one shout shortly before I
began getting the supper. Then as I was getting
the fire going I saw smoke rings rising
from the forest up yonder. They were well done
and they were signals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indianth!&rdquo; breathed Grace. &ldquo;Grathiouth!
We&rsquo;ll all be thcalped. Oh, thave uth!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_014">[014]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I answered them by making some smoke
signals. There wasn&rsquo;t enough smoke in my fire,
though, to do it very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that is what you were up to?&rdquo; laughed
Jane McCarthy. &ldquo;I thought you were fanning
the fire with the blanket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made the answering sign, which they answered
in turn; then there were no more smoke
signals from either side. That is all I know
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke signals,&rdquo; reflected the guardian. &ldquo;I
know of no one in these parts who would know
how to make them. Do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no; no one whom we have reason to
look for here at this time. But I have my suspicions.
If I am right, we shall know about it
either to-night or early to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! tell us,&rdquo; begged Margery eagerly.
&ldquo;Please do tell us what you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleathe don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; commanded Tommy sharply.
&ldquo;If I know, then I won&rsquo;t be curiouth any
more. If I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;ll lie awake all night
thinking and guething about it, and oh, I tell
you I&rsquo;ll enjoy it! I do love a mythtery, and thith
ith a mythtery, ithn&rsquo;t it, Harriet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will call it that. No, not a word, girls;
not another word to-night. I don&rsquo;t want to spoil
Tommy&rsquo;s pleasant prospects. Think what a lot
of comfort she will get out of worrying for fear
<span class="pb" id="Page_015">[015]</span>
that sometime during the night a party of Indians
may swoop down on us, cut off the top of
Tommy&rsquo;s head and run away with her flaxen
locks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat it?&rdquo; glowed Jane McCarthy.
&ldquo;I almost have the shivers myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you girls persist in working up a fright,
I see a nice case of nightmare for some of
you before morning,&rdquo; warned Miss Elting. &ldquo;I
am inclined to the belief that what you saw
must be a camp of timber cruisers or lumbermen.
There are no Indians up here, nor would
any tramps come to this desolate place. Please
don&rsquo;t be foolish. Go on with your supper and
put aside this nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to put it athide!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tommy. &ldquo;I jutht want to be thcared till I&rsquo;m all
fluthtered up; then I want to be thcared thome
more.&rdquo; Tommy leaped from the blanket and
dived head first into their little tent.</p>
<p>At that moment a chorus of wild war-whoops
rose from the bushes all about them. Yell upon
yell sounded, and a great threshing about in the
bushes sent the hearts of the Meadow-Brook
Girls to their throats&mdash;so it seemed to them.
Margery Brown, frightened nearly out of her
wits, sprang up and started to run down the
hill diagonally from the camp. She caught her
foot on the stub of a burned-off sapling, plunged
<span class="pb" id="Page_016">[016]</span>
headforemost and went rolling down a sharp incline,
her cries of alarm heard but faintly by her
companions.</p>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br /><span class="small">THE TRAMPS GUARD THEIR SECRET</span></h2>
<p>Tommy and Margery were the only girls
to ran away. Harriet, Jane, Hazel and
Miss Elting stood their ground. Hazel
for a few seconds was on the point of running
when she saw that Harriet seemed to understand
the meaning of the sudden uproar, which
was still going on.</p>
<p>There came a lull in the whooping and the
shouting. Harriet spoke then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we are properly scared, you may
come out, boys,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys? My stars!&rdquo; muttered Jane. &ldquo;What
boys are you looking for, darlin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out! We know you,&rdquo; commanded
Harriet.</p>
<p>Captain George Baker of the Tramp Club
stepped out into the light of the campfire, a little
shamefaced and uncertain as to how his attempt
to frighten the Meadow-Brook Girls might be
received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Baker!&rdquo; exclaimed the guardian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_017">[017]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; answered George, twisting
his hat nervously in his hands. &ldquo;I&mdash;I hope we
didn&rsquo;t frighten you too much. I&mdash;we&mdash;I thought
you knew we were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly did not. We did know that
some one was up yonder in the woods, because
Harriet saw and answered signals. Was it you
who made the smoke signals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I and the Pickle,&rdquo; he answered, referring to
his friend, Dill Dodd. &ldquo;How do you do, Miss
Brown? Why, what has happened? Been hit
by a cyclone?&rdquo; Certainly Margery looked much
the worse for her tumble. Her skirt was torn,
and her face and hands were scratched, but her
chin was not too much injured for her to be able
to elevate it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t met a cyclone, nor is anything the
matter with me, Mr. Baker,&rdquo; replied Margery,
rather haughtily. &ldquo;When did you come in?
Until just now I didn&rsquo;t know that you were
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George smiled sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where are the boys, George?&rdquo; asked
Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out yonder in the bushes,&rdquo; he replied, conscious
that his face was redder than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is too bad. I should have thought of
them before this. Boys, come into camp!&rdquo;
called Harriet. &ldquo;We wish to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_018">[018]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, fellows. Hike along!&rdquo; commanded
Captain George.</p>
<p>So one at a time the boys of the Tramp Club
filed into the camp of the Meadow-Brook Girls.
They tried to look solemn-faced, yet their eyes
were full of merriment. Dill Dodd led the way;
then came Fred Avery, Sam Crocker, Charlie
Mabie, Will Burgess and Davy Dockrill. The
boys were about the same age as the Meadow-Brook
Girls, though taller and of stronger build.</p>
<p>As the reader of this series knows, this was
not the first meeting of the two clubs. Harriet
and her friends were introduced in the first
volume of this series, &ldquo;<span class="sc">The Meadow-Brook
Girls Under Canvas</span>,&rdquo; which told of their enjoyable
adventures in the Pocono Woods. In
that volume the reader became acquainted with
the grit, zeal and purpose of Harriet Burrell
and her chums, and with the fine influence that
Miss Elting, their teacher-guardian, exercised
over them.</p>
<p>In the second volume, &ldquo;<span class="sc">The Meadow-Brook
Girls across Country</span>,&rdquo; the five girls and their
guardian were shown on their long &ldquo;hike&rdquo;
homeward, as they had elected to go on foot
rather than resort to comfortable travel by
train. Though at this time the Meadow-Brook
Girls met with some unexpected hardships, the
pleasant experiences through which they passed
<span class="pb" id="Page_019">[019]</span>
repaid them for their many troubles. In this
volume, too, as our readers will recall, the girls
first made the acquaintance of the boys of the
Tramp Club, who were destined to prove valued
friends in many a difficulty. But the pranks of
these mischievous lads forced the girls to retaliate
in kind, and not only did they pay their
score, but proved themselves the boys&rsquo; equals in
achievement and endurance on the homeward
hike.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;<span class="sc">The Meadow-Brook Girls Afloat</span>,&rdquo; as
the third volume of the series is entitled, the little
company of girls encountered stirring adventures
as well as mirth-provoking incidents during
their vacation spent under decidedly trying
circumstances on an old houseboat. With the
help of the Tramp Club a mysterious enemy,
who had caused the Meadow-Brook Girls no little
annoyance, was captured, but not until he
had succeeded in setting fire to and burning their
vacation home.</p>
<p>After the destruction of the &ldquo;Red Rover,&rdquo;
their boat, they started at once for the White
Mountains on a long, muscle-trying experiment
in mountain-climbing. All that befell them of
adventure, mystery and rollicking good times is
set forth in &ldquo;<span class="sc">The Meadow-Brook Girls in the
Hills</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not one of our readers has yet forgotten the
<span class="pb" id="Page_020">[020]</span>
great enjoyment furnished by the fifth volume,
&ldquo;<span class="sc">The Meadow-Brook Girls by the Sea</span>.&rdquo; Here
Harriet and her friends were found setting
forth on an expedition without knowing whither
it led, that secret being in the possession only
of Miss Elting, their high school teacher, who
accompanied them on all their jaunts. However,
the trip proved the most exciting that they had
yet had either ashore or afloat.</p>
<p>And now we return to the Meadow-Brook
Girls in camp, to find them at the outset of still
another vacation hike. So far, however, this experience
had proved anything but exciting. So
much adventure on previous trips made the
present life in the woods seem dull by comparison.
So even the coming of the boys was welcomed
as a real event by the Meadow-Brook
Girls.</p>
<p>As the boys came one by one into camp they
were greeted with smiling faces and cordial
handshakes. There could be no doubting the
pleasure of the girls. Harriet had promptly suspected
the presence of the boys when she observed
the smoke signals earlier in the evening.
She knew of no others who would understand
this ancient method of signaling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know how you found us?&rdquo;
said the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found out at Meadow-Brook where you
<span class="pb" id="Page_021">[021]</span>
were. The girls&rsquo; folks told us,&rdquo; replied George.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve a great surprise for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A surprise?&rdquo; asked the girls in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;George looked wisely at his companions&mdash;&ldquo;the
greatest ever. Don&rsquo;t try to guess
it, for you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wath that why you thaw our folkth?&rdquo; demanded
Tommy shrewdly.</p>
<p>Captain George flushed to the roots of his
hair. Tommy had come nearer the mark than
she perhaps thought. Even Margery showed
her curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are ready to hear about this great surprise,&rdquo;
said Miss Elting smilingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll tell you about it, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny place to pitch a camp, this,&rdquo; observed
Sam Crocker, interrupting what Captain
George was saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was thinking about that,&rdquo; declared
George. &ldquo;Whatever induced you to come up to
this hole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thith ithn&rsquo;t a hole, it ith a thide hill,&rdquo; corrected
Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t finish telling us about the surprise,
George,&rdquo; reminded Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so, I didn&rsquo;t, did I? Oh, you will be
surprised and delighted,&rdquo; chuckled George.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dead secret, but I&rsquo;ll tell you about it.
As I was about to say, this is no sort of place for
<span class="pb" id="Page_022">[022]</span>
girls to camp. Now <i>we</i> have picked out a much
better place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up yonder in the woods, or thereabouts.
You must move up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very well satisfied where we are,&rdquo;
replied Harriet Burrell, smiling mischievously.
&ldquo;Of course, if you can give us any really good
reason why we should move our camp, we will
carefully consider your suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a nice place picked out for you.
That&rsquo;s why we want you to move,&rdquo; declared
George bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thay, are you trying to play trickth on
uth?&rdquo; demanded Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. Hope to die, we&rsquo;re not. You&rsquo;ll
see that we are not when you get to the camp we
have chosen for you. Now, we&rsquo;ll be down here
early in the morning and move you right up to
it. You won&rsquo;t have to lift a hand toward making
the new camp. But we must be going. It is
getting late. You&rsquo;ll surely be ready, won&rsquo;t you?
We shall be on hand early,&rdquo; announced the captain,
rising. &ldquo;Come along, fellows, we have
stayed too long already. The girls will begin
telling us to go home if we don&rsquo;t move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait! You haven&rsquo;t told us about the great
secret,&rdquo; cried Margery, unable to restrain her
curiosity any longer. &ldquo;Tell us now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_023">[023]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tell you all about it in the morning,&rdquo;
called back the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know now about the great thecret,&rdquo;
shouted Tommy.</p>
<p>The boys scrambled up the side of the hill,
shouting their good-byes as they hurried on toward
their own camp, leaving the curiosity of
the Meadow-Brook Girls unsatisfied.</p>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br /><span class="small">KEEPING THE GIRLS IN SUSPENSE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t they provoking?&rdquo; pouted Margery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are queer boys,&rdquo; observed
Jane, with a shake of her head.</p>
<p>Harriet laughed gleefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my opinion that the Tramp Club is
preparing to play a joke on the Meadow-Brook
Girls,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;However, I think we are
well able to take care of ourselves. Miss Elting,
what about this proposal to move the
camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is for you girls to decide. I see no objection
to it. The boys no doubt wish to have
us nearer to their own camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they move down here, then?&rdquo;
questioned Jane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_024">[024]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that. What do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will think it over,&rdquo; answered Harriet.
&ldquo;The morning will give us time to decide. We&rsquo;ll
sleep over it rather than decide hastily. I should
like to know what that surprise is that they have
planned for us; that is the kernel in the nut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They just want to tease us,&rdquo; complained
Margery. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they have any surprise
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are wrong, Margery,&rdquo; replied
Miss Elting. &ldquo;Those boys surely have something
that is to be a great surprise to us. If we
don&rsquo;t do as they wish, they may not tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will tell us,&rdquo; nodded Harriet reflectively.
&ldquo;What do you girls say about moving
camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will leave that to you,&rdquo; answered Hazel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us turn in and decide the question
to-morrow morning. I always like to sleep over
anything of this sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I like to know right away,&rdquo; declared
Margery.</p>
<p>They prepared for bed, having first banked
the fire and consulted the skies for weather indications.
The girls did not lie awake long
thinking of the surprise that the Tramp Club
had in store for them. They were far too sleepy
to be particularly curious concerning it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_025">[025]</div>
<p>Breakfast, next morning, was finished by
seven o&rsquo;clock. The birds were darting through
the air, or pouring forth their songs from bush
or tree. The sun was shining brightly, and the
skies were blue and smiling.</p>
<p>The girls had not finished washing the dishes
when a shout from the top of the hill caused
them to look up. Down the incline came the
Tramp Club boys, jumping from rock to rock,
raising a cloud of dust as they plunged recklessly
down the side of the hill toward the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have come to move you,&rdquo; called Captain
George, when still some distance from the
camp. &ldquo;Hurry out of the way before we run
into you and your camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite so fast! We haven&rsquo;t decided to
move,&rdquo; answered Harriet laughingly as the boys
came tearing down to them, flushed and breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We decided that yesterday. You haven&rsquo;t
anything to say about it. Here, Pickle, you drop
that tent. Up with it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tent pegs were drawn and down came the
tent about Margery&rsquo;s ears, she having been at
work setting the tent to rights. Margery uttered
a wail. Davy Dockrill ran to assist her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get in the way of the men,&rdquo; advised
Billy Burgess. &ldquo;They have a big morning&rsquo;s
work ahead of them, and any one who gets in
<span class="pb" id="Page_026">[026]</span>
their way is likely to be run over and perhaps
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gueth they better not run over me,&rdquo;
warned Tommy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d jutht like to thee them
try to run over Tommy Thompthon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The camp already looked very much as though
a tornado had passed over it. The belongings
of the Meadow-Brook Girls lay strewn about the
camp, the tent was flat on the ground, the fire
had been kicked aside and the cooking utensils
dragged out to cool off preparatory to packing
them. Miss Elting gazed at the bold lads smilingly.
Harriet had sat down and was laughing
heartily. Margery was too angry to speak for a
time, after having been assisted from the collapsed
tent by Davy Dockrill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be proper to ask where we are
going?&rdquo; questioned Harriet, after she had succeeded
in controlling her merriment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to a new camp, Miss Burrell,
and you&rsquo;re going to get the surprise of your
young life,&rdquo; answered Captain George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am beginning to think that surprise is a
joke, Captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it isn&rsquo;t. Oh, you girls will be beside
yourselves with joy and sheer delight when
you hear about it,&rdquo; chuckled Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided we are not old ladies by that time
and unable to walk without crutches on account
<span class="pb" id="Page_027">[027]</span>
of our rheumatic joints,&rdquo; retorted Harriet mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you should tell us before we shift our
camp,&rdquo; suggested Miss Elting almost severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not moving your camp, we&rsquo;re moving
it for you, begging your pardon for contradicting
you,&rdquo; answered George, touching his
hat to the guardian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you before we
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime, that camp was disappearing
with greater speed than had ever before
marked the striking of a Meadow-Brook Girls&rsquo;
camp. Thus far the girls had had no part in the
striking. They had made several individual efforts,
only to be thrust aside by the determined
boys. Now and then George would appeal to
Miss Elting as to where this or that article was
to be packed. The girls were never asked. It
was as though they were merely guests.</p>
<p>All was in readiness within half an hour after
the boys had swooped down upon the camp.
Captain George distributed the packs among
his fellows. These were not very heavy loads,
for the girls had taken light packs, knowing
they would have to climb more or less, provided
they followed the hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are ready to move,&rdquo; announced the
captain, himself shouldering the largest of the
packs and nodding to the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_028">[028]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear Captain, we have not yet decided
to move camp,&rdquo; answered Miss Elting,
smiling good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decided? Of course not. It wasn&rsquo;t for you
to decide. We decided that yesterday. You
don&rsquo;t have to come along if you don&rsquo;t want to,
but your equipment is already on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go a step,&rdquo; declared Margery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may, of course, stay here if you wish,&rdquo;
answered the captain politely. &ldquo;May I assist
you up the hill, Miss Elting?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, thank you, Captain, I am quite well
able to climb this hill. Come, girls. I suppose
we might as well give in. It is either that or lose
our equipment. These young men are very
determined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to tell uth what the great
thurprithe ith?&rdquo; demanded Tommy.</p>
<p>George uttered a long-drawn whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, girls, I forgot all about that. Honestly
I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell us now,&rdquo; suggested the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you when we get to the camp.&rdquo;
George began climbing the hill, followed slowly
by the girls and their guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he provoking?&rdquo; grumbled Margery
petulantly.</p>
<p>The boys led the way over the brow of the
hill to the more level ground and on into the
<span class="pb" id="Page_029">[029]</span>
forest that crowned the top of the hill. Reaching
a cleared spot from which the timber had
been cut, the girls found the advance guard of
Tramps at work pitching the tent. There was
a heavy growth of bushes, but the stumps had
been fairly well burned off. The clearing, surrounded
by great trees, was about an acre in extent
and a really attractive camp site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; announced George jovially,
throwing down his pack. &ldquo;You girls just make
yourselves at home while we put the place to
rights. How do you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; answered Harriet frankly. &ldquo;You
have done considerable work here, I see&mdash;cut all
the bushes and leveled off the ground for the
camp. It is very kind in you, Captain. Where
is your camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quarter of a mile to the north,&rdquo; he replied
with a wave of his hand. &ldquo;You will find a
fine spring just the other side of those rocks
yonder. There is an old log road leading in
from the highway. It is a much more convenient
place in every way than the one where you
were camped, and yet not a soul comes here.
We were here for a time last fall. Have you
plenty of provisions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the present,&rdquo; answered Harriet, nodding.
&ldquo;We shall have to go to town within the
week, however.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_030">[030]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No need to do that. There is a farmhouse
a mile from here where we can get everything
we need. We go there for milk every morning.
We can just as well bring your milk at the same
time and anything else you may need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; said the guardian.
&ldquo;But now that we are here, suppose you tell
us about that very great surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George pointed out a pile of wood that they
had gathered, showed Harriet where the spring
lay hidden behind the big rock and pointed out
other advantages of the camp they had chosen
for their friends, the Meadow-Brook Girls, all
of which pleased the girls very much, though
Margery and Tommy would not have shown
their satisfaction for the world.</p>
<p>The camp was pitched in record time that
morning, but the boys kept working about, even
going so far as to make an oven of flat stones.
George then drew from a bag a dozen squirrels
that they had shot that morning. These he proceeded
to skin and dress, after which he spitted
them on sharp sticks ready for broiling over the
fire when luncheon time should have arrived.</p>
<p>The hour for getting the noon meal was at
hand almost before the young people realized
it. Time had passed very rapidly that morning.
The boys got the luncheon that day. By this
time the Meadow-Brook Girls had begun to
<span class="pb" id="Page_031">[031]</span>
enter into the spirit of the fun. They were
chatting and laughing gayly, teasing the Tramp
Boys and criticising their methods of house-keeping.
Luncheon was the jolliest meal they
had enjoyed that season&mdash;so the girls unreservedly
declared. After having finished and before
getting up from their blankets, Captain
George coughed significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, I suppose, you would like to hear about
it,&rdquo; he said teasingly.</p>
<p>Harriet shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having waited this long, I don&rsquo;t think it
would give us much pain to wait longer,&rdquo; she
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Tell us,&rdquo; cried Buster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you weren&rsquo;t curious?&rdquo; taunted
Davy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t keep us in suspense, Captain. Tell
us now. You don&rsquo;t have to be coaxed to tell, do
you?&rdquo; asked Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we are really anxious to tell you the
whole story, and I know you&rsquo;ll all shout with delight
when you hear it,&rdquo; answered Captain
George.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_032">[032]</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br /><span class="small">AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE</span></h2>
<p>The captain of the Tramp Club leaned back
and, clasping his hands about his knees,
gazed reflectively at the blue sky overhead.
The eyes of the Meadow-Brook Girls
were fixed inquiringly on his brown face. Captain
George appeared to be in no hurry to tell
them of the surprise that the Tramps had in
store for the girls. Tommy was the first to
break the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thith thuthpenthe ith killing,&rdquo; she observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t hurry him,&rdquo; scoffed Crazy Jane.
&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be half so interesting after he has
told it; and, what&rsquo;s more, he knows it. That&rsquo;s
why he&rsquo;s so long about telling. Suppose you
wait until after supper, George? The evening
is so much better for telling fairy stories. Then
we can all go to bed and have nightmares!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a joke,&rdquo; protested Sam Crocker
a trifle impatiently. &ldquo;This is dead serious business,
as you will realize before you have done
with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; commented Buster sarcastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; returned Sam sharply. &ldquo;Better
tell them and have it out of your system.
<span class="pb" id="Page_033">[033]</span>
I&rsquo;m getting a little tired of their not believing
us. They will believe all right after they hear
the glad and joyous tidings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe motht anything,&rdquo; Tommy informed
them solemnly. &ldquo;And we believe you
folkth don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about.
Do you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will give me half a chance, I will tell
you,&rdquo; answered George. &ldquo;Did you ever hear
of Newtown, on the coast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. That is a fashionable summer resort,&rdquo;
said Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so. Ever hear of the Atlantic Coast
Tennis Tournaments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Miss Elting. &ldquo;I have understood
that they were a feature of the summer at
Newtown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; agreed George. &ldquo;They are the
biggest and most important affairs ever pulled
off along the coast, and don&rsquo;t you lose sight of
that for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t. What next?&rdquo; demanded Grace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_034">[034]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In this tournament,&rdquo; continued Captain
Baker, &ldquo;there are many classes and many valuable
prizes. No money prizes, of course, for this
is purely an amateur tournament, but it brings
out some crack players, you may depend upon
that. The best players there are in New England
come down to Newtown to match their skill
against their fellows. People journey many
miles to attend this tournament, which usually
lasts several days, sometimes a week. Most of
the contests are bitterly fought. More national
tennis players have graduated from that tournament
than from any other in the United
States. I know, because Jack Herrington, the
manager of the tournament, told me so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a great honor even to be entered at
Newtown,&rdquo; declared George. &ldquo;Believe me, not
every one can get an entry there. Oh, it&rsquo;s very
select and one has to be well up in the lists to
get an entry, but once having entered there is
no backing out. The entries are closed now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When is this tournament to take place?&rdquo;
questioned Miss Elting, interested, though she
could not satisfactorily explain to herself why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five weeks from now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you boys going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we going?&rdquo; fairly shouted George.
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t keep us away with a team of elephants.
I rather guess we are going, and we
shall stay till the last ball is batted over the net
and the prizes awarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are going to play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish we might, but there are no classes for
boys. Herrington promises to have a class for
<span class="pb" id="Page_035">[035]</span>
us next season. You will see the Tramp Club
on hand with the racquets then and you&rsquo;ll all
come to see us cover the name of the Tramp
Club with glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done that already,&rdquo; said Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; The boys took off their hats
and bowed gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued George, &ldquo;I feel that I
have scored a greater triumph this year than
I ever shall by playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; asked the guardian politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve entered a winning team, entered
a team that all the amateurs along the
coast couldn&rsquo;t beat. Why? Because the team,
my team, I call them, wouldn&rsquo;t know it if they
were beaten. They&rsquo;d keep right on playing till
the Atlantic itself froze over, if somebody
didn&rsquo;t cut in and stop them. That&rsquo;s why. You
watch our entry and see if they don&rsquo;t set the
State of New Hampshire howling like a parcel
of mad Indians. Ever see a mad Indian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen what I thought was one,&rdquo; answered
Jane significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen the real thing nor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are still waiting for the great mystery
to be solved,&rdquo; reminded Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m solving it as rapidly as possible. Nor
will you see the genuine article till after the
tournament at Newtown is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_036">[036]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all agreed on that point,&rdquo; interjected
Charlie Mabie. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t another team in
the State that can hold its own with our entries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sincerely hope you young gentlemen may
not be disappointed. I should like to see your
team play and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See them play?&rdquo; exploded Davy. &ldquo;I should
say you would. If you didn&rsquo;t, we could never
forgive you. Of course you will see them play.
The idea of your having any doubts on the subject!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear boys, why should I be so interested,
not knowing any of the contestants, not
even knowing who your team may be?&rdquo; expostulated
the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;not&mdash;not know?&rdquo; shouted Dill Dodd.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he added in a lower
voice. &ldquo;I had forgotten that you didn&rsquo;t know
them. But you will&mdash;you will&mdash;and when you do
you&rsquo;ll be just as enthusiastic as we are, maybe
more so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be impossible,&rdquo; said Harriet,
smiling and nodding.</p>
<p>The boys themselves were becoming excited.
They were fairly bursting with impatience to
blurt out the whole story. George Baker was
not telling it nearly fast enough to suit them.
Tommy and Margery shared their impatience.
<span class="pb" id="Page_037">[037]</span>
Tommy&rsquo;s face was working nervously and Margery
was making a desperate effort to be calm.
They felt sure that there was more to the story,
more of interest to themselves than they could
even guess.</p>
<p>They were not wrong in their surmise. There
was more to tell, as they were speedily to learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the prizes worth while?&rdquo; asked Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A silver cup for the winning team. It&rsquo;s
worth more than a hundred dollars, and will
have the name of the winning club engraved on
it. Then there will be individual prizes. There
are second and third prizes, too, but I don&rsquo;t
know what they are. I didn&rsquo;t ask Herrington,
for the reason that I wasn&rsquo;t interested. I was
interested in the first prize. Our team will get
it, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet was regarding him with narrowed
eyes now, her forehead wrinkled into lines of
perplexity. The way George was looking at her
set the girl to wondering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is your team, George?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is my team? Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; he almost
shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally not. You haven&rsquo;t told us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t mind readers, George,&rdquo; reminded
Billy Burgess. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll confess that you&rsquo;ve
almost got me guessing. You&rsquo;ve so befuddled
<span class="pb" id="Page_038">[038]</span>
me that I&rsquo;m beginning to wonder if I know who
they are myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys burst out into a jolly laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell them and be done with it. For goodness&rsquo;
sake, quit circumnavigating the globe,&rdquo;
scoffed Davy. &ldquo;I could walk to town and back
while you are saying &lsquo;No, thank you.&rsquo; Speak
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you haven&rsquo;t guessed yet?&rdquo; questioned
George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are more in the dark than when you began,&rdquo;
replied Harriet. &ldquo;Who is to play on
your team?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, <i>you</i> are, of course. The Meadow-Brook
Girls are our team. You are the players
who are going to win the tennis championship
for the coast, and you&rsquo;re going to put all the
others so far back of the lines that they won&rsquo;t
be able to find themselves for the rest of the
summer. Now, what do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Harriet sat up very straight, looking
George Baker squarely in the eyes. &ldquo;Why,
Mr. Baker, none of us has ever played a game of
tennis in her life.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_039">[039]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br /><span class="small">THE TRAMP CLUB RECEIVES A SHOCK</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Quit joking. I mean what I say,&rdquo; commanded
Captain Baker somewhat
testily. &ldquo;Of course I know you girls
play tennis as well as you do everything else.
Knowing this, I hadn&rsquo;t the least hesitancy in entering
you for the tournament. I told Jack
Herrington all about you. He insisted on my
making the entry right there and then. You see,
he had heard of the Meadow-Brook Girls. He
knew almost as much about their accomplishments
as I did myself. He said that was just
the kind of entries they wished for the Atlantic
Coast Tennis Tournament. I was mighty glad
he said that, for I really wanted you girls to go
in and win the cup, so I made the entry in Miss
Harriet&rsquo;s name per George Baker as representative.
There are girl teams entered from all
along the coast and they are cracker-jacks, too,
but they aren&rsquo;t in the same class with you girls,
either in tennis or anything else. Now, isn&rsquo;t
that great?&rdquo; Captain George&rsquo;s face was flushed
and his eyes were sparkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great?&rdquo; answered Harriet slowly. &ldquo;I told
you none of us ever had played a game of
<span class="pb" id="Page_040">[040]</span>
tennis in her life, and I meant it. Some of us
have knocked the ball about a little with the
racquets, but not one of us ever has played a
game. Why, we know absolutely nothing about
tennis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? You&mdash;you mean to say&mdash;you mean
you are in earnest&mdash;you aren&rsquo;t joking with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was never more serious in my life,
George,&rdquo; replied Harriet gravely.</p>
<p>Captain George Baker looked as he felt&mdash;thunderstruck&mdash;while
his companions&rsquo; faces reflected
his consternation. George groaned dismally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve entered you. You must go
through with it,&rdquo; he expostulated.</p>
<p>Harriet shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is out of the question, George. Miss Elting
plays, I believe. Let her take the entry
for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t eligible,&rdquo; objected George. &ldquo;This
entry is for girls not more than eighteen years
old. Of course you will play,&rdquo; he added with a
more hopeful note in his tone. &ldquo;I know well
enough that you play, and play superbly. No
girls who are such clever girls, out-of-doors as
well as in, could help playing tennis. Besides,
you will have to do it now. I tell you I&rsquo;ve entered
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_041">[041]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, George. I am sorry, but you will have
to withdraw our entry, explaining to Mr. Herrington
that we don&rsquo;t play and that you were
led into the making of the entry by his urging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The papers have printed the entries,&rdquo;
shouted George. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;ve told all about
you,&rdquo; he added in a tone of misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show them what the papers printed,
George,&rdquo; urged Dill.</p>
<p>Captain George drew a wrinkled piece of
newspaper from his blouse pocket and flattened
it out on one knee with the palms of his hands.
He regarded the paper ruefully, then handed it
to Dodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You read it, Dill. My voice is going back
on me. I must have yelled myself hoarse this
morning. It&rsquo;s all about you, girls. You will
see that you&rsquo;ve got to go through with this business,
no matter what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; exclaimed Dodd. &ldquo;Are you ready
for the question? The question is to play or not
to play. This is an item in the &lsquo;Newtown Register&rsquo;
and, as you will observe, was written with
a complete knowledge of all the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it. Don&rsquo;t waste so much time talking,&rdquo;
cried Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The item is as follows,&rdquo; said Dill. &ldquo;That
is, I shall read only that part relating to you
<span class="pb" id="Page_042">[042]</span>
girls and your entry. What it says about the
other entries, of course, will be of no interest to
you just now. Later on it may. I quote from
the &lsquo;Register&rsquo;: &lsquo;Not the least interesting among
the entries for the Atlantic Coast Tennis Tournament
is that of the Meadow-Brook Girls of
Meadow-Brook, New Hampshire. This is not,
strictly speaking, a tennis club. The young women
who form this organization have become
known to the public by reason of numerous vacation
tours which they have made on foot and
by automobile throughout the State. Their
thorough athletic training, coupled with their
proficiency in outdoor sports, will make them
formidable contestants. We shall welcome
them to the Coast Tournament and hope to have
them with us as long as they remain eligible for
the classes offered here.&rsquo; Then follows the family
history of each of you girls,&rdquo; added Dill mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grathiouth, you don&rsquo;t thay tho!&rdquo; exclaimed
Tommy. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t my father be ath
mad ath a hatter! He thayth young girlth
thhould be theen but not heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another from the &lsquo;Gazette,&rsquo;&rdquo; announced
George, passing a second slip to his
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Great interest is being manifested in the
entry of the well known organization who call
<span class="pb" id="Page_043">[043]</span>
themselves the Meadow-Brook Girls,&rsquo;&rdquo; read
Dill. &ldquo;&lsquo;Their coming is awaited with deep interest
by the summer visitors as well as the regular
residents of Newtown, who are justly proud
of old New Hampshire&rsquo;s girls.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear you have involved yourself and us
in a scrape, Captain George,&rdquo; said Miss Elting.
&ldquo;I know something about tennis, and
have played a few games. I know, too, that
long practice is necessary even to play an ordinary
game of it. But even in my case, I can&rsquo;t
say that I know enough about the game to instruct
any one else. You must go to Mr. Herrington
and tell him frankly that the entry was
made under a misapprehension, and that it must
be withdrawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, after all thothe complimentth?&rdquo; demanded
Tommy. &ldquo;Never! I&rsquo;ll play the whole
tournament mythelf firtht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, George,&rdquo; insisted the guardian, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t
possible. You must cancel the entry. My girls
do not play tennis, and that is all there is about
it. I am, of course, ineligible, much as I should
like to keep up the reputation of the Meadow-Brook
Girls. We are very sorry to disappoint
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George will have to go to Newtown and tell
Herrington all about it,&rdquo; declared Dill. &ldquo;We
have made fools of ourselves, but through no
<span class="pb" id="Page_044">[044]</span>
fault of the girls. We should have found out
whether or not they played the game before entering
them in the tournament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think for a minute that it could be
possible they didn&rsquo;t play. I didn&rsquo;t suppose
there was anything they couldn&rsquo;t do, and I&rsquo;m
half inclined to believe they are fooling us now,&rdquo;
declared George. &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice trailed off into an unintelligible
mumble as he observed the troubled eyes of
Harriet Burrell fixed upon him. &ldquo;Oh, shoot the
whole business!&rdquo; he exploded.</p>
<p>Billy Burgess had in the meantime beckoned
to Sam. The two boys slunk out of camp and
a few moments later were observed staggering
back, bearing some heavy burden between them.
The girls could not imagine what the boys were
bringing into camp. George knew, however. He
started up, his face flushing angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it away!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want
it. What are you fellows trying to do, make a
bigger fool of me than I am already?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be impossible,&rdquo; laughed Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, what have you there?&rdquo;
cried Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The makings,&rdquo; answered Dill. &ldquo;And it was
an unlucky day for us, when we bought them,
wasn&rsquo;t it, Captain George Baker?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_045">[045]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better drag that thing out of here,&rdquo;
roared George, now thoroughly angry. &ldquo;Am I
the captain of this club or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it away, boys. We want to know
what it is. Is this bundle a mystery, another of
your great surprises?&rdquo; demanded Jane McCarthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the treat that was to be,&rdquo; Dill informed
them. &ldquo;Of course, it isn&rsquo;t a treat now,
it&rsquo;s just a sad reminder of what might have
been, but we thought you might like to have a
look. You&rsquo;ll see what you have missed and we
shall shed tears, George shedding crocodile
tears. If you wish to know how a crocodile
weeps, just observe the eyes of our noble captain.
George, prepare to weep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, keep quiet!&rdquo; growled George Baker.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll trounce you if you keep on. Are you going
to take that thing away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until our very good friends, the Meadow-Brook
Girls, have had an opportunity to see
it and learn what a chance to distinguish themselves
they have missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have aroused our curiosity,&rdquo; said the
guardian laughingly. &ldquo;You simply must let us
into this new secret. Such boys! I never saw
your like! I&rsquo;ll confess that I am as curious as
any of my girls. What have you there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_046">[046]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The makings, I said,&rdquo; answered Dill Dodd&mdash;&ldquo;the
making of world champions and championesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; answered Miss Elting,
glancing from one to another of the boys. The
latter were now smiling broadly, all save Captain
Baker himself, whose face was gloomy, his
gaze fixed morosely on the ground.</p>
<p>Sam Crocker drew a knife from his pocket,
opened it and felt the edge of the blade with aggravating
deliberateness, then suddenly cut the
heavy twine that held the bundle together.</p>
<p>The bundle sprang open. The two lads grabbed
the contents and quickly spread them out
over the ground in front of the girls&rsquo; tent. The
Meadow-Brooks were silent for a few seconds;
then broke out into exclamations of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look!&rdquo; cried Margery shrilly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you boys, you boys!&rdquo; exclaimed the
guardian, her eyes glowing with an excitement
and pleasure that she made no effort to conceal.
&ldquo;How really unkind we have been to you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_047">[047]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br /><span class="small">A DISCOURAGING TRY-OUT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;And you have done all this for us?&rdquo;
asked Miss Elting, stepping over and
placing a hand on the shoulder of the
disconsolate George, who, sitting with his chin
in his palms, never so much as glanced up at
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; just for the sake of showing you what
fools fellows can make of themselves,&rdquo; he answered
sourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that, Captain,&rdquo; begged Harriet,
running to him. &ldquo;We shall never forget
your goodness&mdash;never! It was splendid in
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A real tennis net!&rdquo; cried Margery. &ldquo;What
a lot of fun we shall have with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a splendid outfit, too,&rdquo; declared Miss
Elting, examining the contents of the bundle
with critical eyes; &ldquo;everything complete, even
to racquets, and the best to be had in the market,
too. Oh, how can we thank you? But isn&rsquo;t
this outfit new?&rdquo; she asked, a sudden thought
occurring to her.</p>
<p>Sam nodded and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom does it belong?&rdquo; she continued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_048">[048]</div>
<p>He waved his hand as indicating that it was
the property of the Tramp Club. In the meantime
George&rsquo;s face was taking on a deeper flush,
the heel of one boot was digging more and more
savagely into the turf, and his hair, through
which he had run his fingers, was standing up
wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The property of the Tramp Club?&rdquo; repeated
the guardian.</p>
<p>Sam nodded, but George did not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you get it?&rdquo; questioned Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It came the day before yesterday,&rdquo; Dill informed
her. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been looking for it for
more than a week&mdash;we could hardly wait till it
got here. When it came, we hustled right over
to Meadow-Brook, where we learned that you
were out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but you didn&rsquo;t carry it all the way
from Meadow-Brook here, did you?&rdquo; demanded
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t tote it,&rdquo; answered Sam. &ldquo;We
got a farmer who was on his way out here to
carry it in his wagon. We carried it up from
the road, about a mile. That was far enough.
We are very sorry we had all our trouble for
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re <i>not</i> sorry!&rdquo; roared George. &ldquo;We
aren&rsquo;t sorry for anything we do for the Meadow-Brook
<span class="pb" id="Page_049">[049]</span>
Girls. The fellow who says that isn&rsquo;t
a Tramp by a long shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean it just that way,&rdquo; apologized
Sam. &ldquo;You know what I meant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet, who had been watching the faces of
the boys and listening to what was said, had
already come to a certain conclusion regarding
the thoughtfulness of the boys. She put that
conclusion into words a few moments later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you boys bought this outfit,
net, balls, racquets and all? Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly did,&rdquo; cried Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you keep quiet?&rdquo; demanded George
angrily. &ldquo;You ramble on and tell everything
you know almost before you are asked. We got
that outfit, ladies, because we wanted it and for
no other reason. We thought, seeing you were
going to play in the tournament at Newtown,
that you might like to practise while you were
out here. That&rsquo;s all there is to it. Don&rsquo;t pay
any attention to what Sam says; he isn&rsquo;t always
responsible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet was not deceived. Neither was Miss
Elting. It was plain to both that George Baker
and his fellows had purchased this tennis outfit
solely in the interest of the Meadow-Brook
Girls. The guardian, knowing something of
these matters, realized that the boys must have
purchased the outfit at a great personal sacrifice,
<span class="pb" id="Page_050">[050]</span>
thus increasing her wonder and admiration
for the unselfish Tramp Club. As a matter of
fact, the boys had sacrificed their pocket money
in order to get the outfit, fully expecting the girls
to be overcome with joy. Instead of this the
girls had met them with the amazing news that
they had never played a game of tennis in their
lives!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bought it for us,&rdquo; reflected Harriet,
with her chin in her hand, regarding the disconsolate
George with thoughtful eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we purchase the outfit?&rdquo; suggested
Miss Elting.</p>
<p>Captain George sprang up, his face reflecting
his indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we are that kind of fellows?&rdquo;
he demanded. &ldquo;I beg your pardon. I didn&rsquo;t
mean to speak to you in that tone, Miss Elting,&rdquo;
he apologized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not apologize. We accept your
kind thoughtfulness and appreciate the spirit
behind it. But it is too bad that you have had
to be so disappointed. Let me think it over and
see what can be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be done,&rdquo; groaned George.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in up to our chins and we&rsquo;re going in
up to our eyes before we&rsquo;ve done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy and Margery had taken up racquets
and balls and were batting the balls about,
<span class="pb" id="Page_051">[051]</span>
shouting delightedly. They already had volleyed
one ball off into the bushes and lost it.
Billy Burgess was down on his knees crawling
about in the bushes in search of it. Already a
hopeful spirit was apparent in the faces of
nearly all the boys and most of the girls. Harriet
was thoughtful, while Miss Elting smiled
her appreciation upon the boys, of whom she
was almost as fond as of her own young charges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would suggest that we put up the net.
Even if we aren&rsquo;t able to play, we shall be able
to have a lot of enjoyment out of the tennis outfit,&rdquo;
said Harriet. &ldquo;Do you object to our using
it while we are here, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Object?&rdquo; George Baker was on his feet
instantly, the set lines of his face relaxing somewhat.
&ldquo;Well, I should say not! Do you really
mean that you&rsquo;ll play over the net?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about playing,&rdquo; answered
Harriet laughingly. &ldquo;We will agree to volley
the balls back and forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fooling me!&rdquo; shouted George. &ldquo;You
said &lsquo;<i>volley</i>.&rsquo; No one but a tennis player would
know about that word. Hurrah! Put up the
net, fellows. We&rsquo;ll see about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do not deceive yourself,&rdquo; begged
Harriet. &ldquo;We have told you the simple truth.
We do not play. I knew the word and what it
means, having heard Miss Elting use it. But we
<span class="pb" id="Page_052">[052]</span>
will put up the net just the same and have ever
and ever so much fun. I&rsquo;ll tell you what,
George. You teach us how to play. Miss Elting
will play with you. She can play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indifferently,&rdquo; answered the guardian. &ldquo;I
fear I should cut but a sorry figure with such
experts as the Tramp Club, especially such an
expert as Mr. Baker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expert! Ho-ho! Ha-ha!&rdquo; chuckled Sam.
&ldquo;Wait till you see him play! Oh, yes, he&rsquo;s the
original and unconquerable champion of the
Granite State. Get busy, fellows. Don&rsquo;t stand
about like a lot of wooden Indians waiting to be
placed on your pedestals. There aren&rsquo;t any pedestals
here. If there were, you wouldn&rsquo;t occupy
them, not while there are ladies present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where shall we place the net?&rdquo; asked Hazel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over yonder,&rdquo; answered George. &ldquo;You
must level off the ground first, boys.&rdquo; He was
full of new interest now. &ldquo;Wait. I&rsquo;ll trim
down the bushes, then some of you get to work
and dig them up&mdash;dig up the roots, I mean. It&rsquo;s
not exactly an ideal place for a court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys fell to with a will, the girls getting
to work assisting them in clearing the ground in
preparation for a tennis court. Nearly an hour
was occupied with this work, with the result
that a fairly level and smooth court had been
constructed, George having paced off the measurements
<span class="pb" id="Page_053">[053]</span>
so that they were almost accurate.
It would not do for the girls to learn on a court
that was either too large or too small, for this
would have an effect on their playing when they
came to play on a real court.</p>
<p>While the others were setting the net, George
with a stick was busily engaged in marking out
the base line and other lines of the court. All
this was of interest to the Meadow-Brook Girls
because they did not understand the purpose of
it. They had no idea what the lines were for
nor why they should be there at all. But Harriet
early began asking questions, and by the
time the markings were down she had some inkling
as to their uses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chalk is used to mark the lines ordinarily,&rdquo;
explained George. &ldquo;Having no chalk, we fall
back on a sharp stick. The lines aren&rsquo;t very
plain, but plain enough, I guess, for all we shall
require of them. I reckon we&rsquo;ll have time to
volley a few times before night,&rdquo; he added, consulting
the skies. &ldquo;I know you girls are going
to give us the surprise of our young lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; agreed Harriet, balancing a racquet
on the first finger of her right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you learn to do that?&rdquo; demanded
the captain sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know I was doing anything
so remarkable,&rdquo; stammered Harriet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_054">[054]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a trick of expert tennis players to
learn whether a racquet is properly balanced.
You needn&rsquo;t tell me you don&rsquo;t know anything
about the game. Sam, bring a ball here. You
fellows are going to get a surprise in about a
minute and a half. Harriet, you and Hazel take
your places. No, not in the middle of the court&mdash;diagonally
in those squares. There. Now
play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet tossed up the ball and made a swing
at it with the racquet. She did not even hit the
ball. Her companions laughed merrily at her
awkwardness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try again. That was no stroke,&rdquo; said
George.</p>
<p>Harriet tried again, sending the ball toward
Hazel. Hazel struck at it with so much force
that she spun her body completely about, but
she did not hit it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; cried Hazel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone where the poison ivy twineth,&rdquo; announced
Sam solemnly. &ldquo;I reckon that ball is
going yet. Woof! What a stroke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that after a service in the
beginning of the game the ball must first touch
the ground and be taken on the first rebound?&rdquo;
asked Dill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I didn&rsquo;t mean to hit it so hard,&rdquo;
apologized Harriet. &ldquo;Better luck next time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_055">[055]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t <i>mean</i> to hit it so hard,&rdquo; mocked
Sam.</p>
<p>Billy recovered the ball after considerable
hunting about in the bushes. In the meantime
another ball had been pressed into service. This
time Harriet succeeded in serving it into the
court of her opponent, but Hazel did not see it
coming. The ball rolled out of bounds and lay
waiting to be picked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me the truth, are you girls playing
off?&rdquo; demanded George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; answered Harriet laughingly.
&ldquo;Is there still a lurking idea in your mind that
we really do know how to play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was, up to a few moments ago. I
know she doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; pointing to Hazel. &ldquo;There
couldn&rsquo;t be any mistake about that. Nobody
could make-believe play-off like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me thhow them how to play,&rdquo; piped
Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You and Margery have a try-out,&rdquo;
suggested Miss Elting.</p>
<p>Harriet and Hazel willingly gave way to their
two companions. Margery started in by grasping
the racquet firmly in both hands. George
shook his head sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think you are playing&mdash;baseball?&rdquo;
demanded Sam jeeringly. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
bat in tennis. We hold the racquet artistically
<span class="pb" id="Page_056">[056]</span>
in one hand, then, when the ball meanders over
into our court, we give it a genteel swat in the
northeast corner; next, biff! bump! bang! Back
she comes again, just starving to death for
more. Do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Elting laughed merrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your description is graphic, indeed,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I think Margery will have no difficulty in
returning her opponent&rsquo;s service after that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buthter ith too fat to play anything but football,&rdquo;
averred Tommy. &ldquo;Thhe would be a thuctheth
in football becauthe thhe could fall on the
ball and hold it down tho nobody elthe could get
it. Do I hit the ball firtht?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she hit it first?&rdquo; groaned Bill. &ldquo;You
&lsquo;serve&rsquo; it. That&rsquo;s the polite way to express
what Sam would call the opening swat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what do I do?&rdquo; questioned Margery.</p>
<p>Miss Elting here took a hand in the instruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When your opponent serves the ball into
your court, you let the ball strike the ground,
bound up into the air, then you volley it back
into your opponent&rsquo;s court. Then, the ball being
in play, you do not have to let it strike the
ground again unless you wish to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can I help its striking the ground
if it wants to?&rdquo; cried Buster.</p>
<p>George groaned dismally at this question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_057">[057]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By hitting it!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Keep the ball
going as long as there is any &lsquo;go&rsquo; left in it.
Play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; shouted Tommy, and without
waiting for her opponent to prepare herself, she
served the ball with a fairly well directed stroke,
so accurate, in fact, that the ball sped true to its
mark, hitting Buster squarely on the nose. The
hurt of it was not so great as was the surprise.
Margery staggered and fell over on her back,
to the accompaniment of shouts of laughter from
both boys and girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gueth I can play,&rdquo; declared Tommy
proudly, &ldquo;but Buthter ith too fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did it on purpose,&rdquo; cried Margery, getting
to her feet and touching her nose gingerly
with the tips of her fingers. &ldquo;Is it bleeding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t bleeding,&rdquo; assured George sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t bleeding it&rsquo;s broken. Oh, my poor
nose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy was regarding her quizzically, her
shrewd little face wrinkled into sharp lines.
Tommy was very proud of her accomplishment,
for did it not prove that she was very skilful
and Margery not?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think myself that Margery is not a success
at tennis,&rdquo; answered Miss Elting. &ldquo;I believe
you had better give it up and let Harriet
<span class="pb" id="Page_058">[058]</span>
and Jane have an opportunity. Jane hasn&rsquo;t
held a racquet yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! I&rsquo;ll play if it kills me,&rdquo; declared Margery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; cried Sam. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
spirit that wins games and everything else!
But,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Tommy Thompson,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you be so violent this time, Grace.
Take it more slowly to begin with. Just drop it
over into the other court; send it over so slowly
that Margery cannot fail to see it. Easy as falling
off a log.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play!&rdquo; commanded George.</p>
<p>This time Tommy made three passes before
she succeeded in hitting the ball. She gave
a gentle lift on the third stroke, serving it over
the net, barely missing the net itself. Margery,
following Sam Crocker&rsquo;s advice, ran toward
the ball making wild swings with her racquet.
Luckily, ball and racquet met. Margery gave
the ball a toss, but it was more the force of her
forward lunge than the stroke that sent the ball
over the net. The girl herself kept right on
going. From sheer force of her momentum she
could not stop.</p>
<p>In the meantime Tommy had darted forward
to meet the ball and volley it back into the opposite
court. Just before reaching the net she
stubbed her toe on a root that had been overlooked,
sprawled head first into the net, and
became hopelessly entangled in its meshes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_059">[059]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thave me!&rdquo; moaned Tommy.</p>
<p>Buster, who was still lunging forward, tripped
also and plunged forward head first, her
own head bumping Tommy&rsquo;s with great force.</p>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br /><span class="small">THE MEADOW-BROOK GIRLS CHANGE THEIR MINDS</span></h2>
<p>For a full minute the two camps were so
convulsed with laughter that they were
unable to go to the rescue of the two unfortunate
tennis players, now so thoroughly
wound up in the net as to be quite helpless. The
more they tried to extricate themselves the more
entangled did they become.</p>
<p>Then something else was discovered. Sam
Crocker was seen groveling on the ground, both
bands clapped tightly against his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; demanded
Dill Dodd after the two unfortunates, bruised
and sore, had been assisted out of the net.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had eyes you could see without asking
so many questions. She let the racquet go when
she struck at the ball and it got me. The end
of the handle hit me on the nose. It&rsquo;s harder
than iron, too. It&rsquo;s broken, as sure as you&rsquo;re
<span class="pb" id="Page_060">[060]</span>
alive. Oh, why did I ever permit myself to get
into this scrape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is too bad,&rdquo; replied Dill sympathetically.
&ldquo;Here we go and buy the best racquets
to be had, then you have to break one the first
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; yelled Sam. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the racquet
that was broken, it was my nose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy and Margery, after having escaped
from the net, had sat down heavily. Sam still
sat where Tommy&rsquo;s racquet had laid him low,
nursing his injured nose and rocking his body to
and fro.</p>
<p>The campers screamed with laughter. He
presented such a ludicrous figure that they could
not help laughing. Even Miss Elting could not
hide her amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Laugh if you want to. I&rsquo;d
laugh myself if I weren&rsquo;t afraid of ruining my
nose forever. They deserve to be laughed at,&rdquo;
he declared angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We aren&rsquo;t laughing at Tommy and Margery,
we are laughing at you,&rdquo; cried Crazy
Jane.</p>
<p>Harriet, in the meantime, had brought a basin
of water and, kneeling down, was washing the
blood from Sam&rsquo;s damaged nasal organ. As
she wiped away the blood she observed that his
nose was leaning slightly to one side. Dill, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_061">[061]</span>
had been an interested spectator, had observed
the same thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of plumb, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he questioned quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s broken. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you it was?&rdquo;
groaned Sam. &ldquo;I may not know everything, but
I know my own nose and I know when it&rsquo;s
broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guardian stepped over to where Sam and
Harriet were sitting. She examined Sam&rsquo;s
nose carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you twitht it a little you can tell whether it
ith broken or not,&rdquo; suggested Tommy.</p>
<p>Sam yelled in anguish at the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare try it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind Tommy. She is just a little savage,&rdquo;
chuckled Harriet. &ldquo;Neither Miss Elting
nor I would give you the slightest unnecessary
pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds very well, Harriet. I fear,
however, that I shall have to give Sam quite a
little pain,&rdquo; said the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; cried Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First straighten your nose, then bolster it so
it will stay straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I get the tent pole?&rdquo; asked Dill eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_062">[062]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wear out my patience, fellows,&rdquo;
warned Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a wounded man, I&rsquo;m a desperate
man and I&rsquo;m not wholly responsible for
what I say or do. Are&mdash;are you going to twist
it, Miss Elting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t call it that. I am going to shape
it, to mould it, restore it to its natural shape as
nearly as I can, then secure it there with adhesive
plaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, that ith the way,&rdquo; agreed Tommy,
nodding eagerly. &ldquo;Let me help you, Mith Elting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will please keep away from me.
Haven&rsquo;t you done enough damage as it is?&rdquo;
demanded Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ith what I get for trying to be helpful,&rdquo;
answered Tommy in an aggrieved tone.
&ldquo;Any one would think I had broken your nothe
on purpothe. I didn&rsquo;t break it at all; the racquet
broke it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind him. He doesn&rsquo;t know what he
is talking about,&rdquo; soothed George. &ldquo;Shall I
hold his hands while you are making temporary
repairs, Miss Elting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you boys will go way back somewhere
and sit down, we&rsquo;ll have the job done in a few
minutes,&rdquo; suggested Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please do not interfere,&rdquo; urged the
guardian. &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t jerk, Sam. I am going
to straighten your nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam winced as she pressed his nose back to
<span class="pb" id="Page_063">[063]</span>
its normal position, and his hands gripped a
handful of dirt from the tennis court, but he
uttered no sound. While the guardian held the
nose in place she instructed Harriet Burrell how
to place the adhesive plaster, which Harriet did
with delicate, skilful fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it hurt much?&rdquo; asked the girl sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt? Oh, no. It is the pleasantest sensation
I ever enjoyed. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to
make myself believe,&rdquo; he added, speaking
thickly, so as not to strain the muscles of his
face. &ldquo;But how am I going to breathe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have your mouth left,&rdquo; laughed Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; announced the guardian finally, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe a surgeon could have done better.
How do you think he looks, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys gathered about Sam, hands thrust
into their trousers pockets, and regarded him
solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gueth,&rdquo; smiled Tommy, &ldquo;if you would
thtand him up in a cornfield he would thcare all
the crowth away. He lookth jutht like a thcare
crow, doethn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was going to suggest,&rdquo; added
Dill. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d scare the crows all right and the
owner of the corn patch, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Sam, dolefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_064">[064]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo; The guardian smiled down into
the boyish face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could see how I look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy ran into the tent, returning quickly
with a hand mirror, which she handed to the
boy she had unwittingly wounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out that your face doesn&rsquo;t break it,&rdquo;
warned Dill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my face doesn&rsquo;t, your head may,&rdquo; retorted
Sam sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of it?&rdquo; asked Dill
Dodd with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think? Why, I think I should rather have
my face than yours right this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This thrust restored Sam to good humor once
more. His companions and the girls joined in
the laugh at Dodd&rsquo;s expense. The boys had replaced
the net, but the hour was too late to think
of having further practice. Harriet said they
must begin to prepare their supper. The boys
decided that it was time they were getting back
to camp and starting their own evening meal.
They declined an invitation to remain and take
supper with the Meadow-Brook party. Harriet
begged them to sit down a little while until the
fire was fairly started. Instead, they placed the
wood and started the fire for her, after which
Hazel, whose turn it was to get supper that
night, promptly set about her task.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_065">[065]</div>
<p>Captain Baker relapsed into his gloomy state
again. The recollection of the miserable failure
of all his carefully laid plans rankled in his
mind. He knew now that the girls were not deceiving
him when they said they knew nothing
about tennis playing. He had never seen a more
pitiful exhibition than that of the afternoon;
he hoped never to see another like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll have to tell Herrington, I suppose,&rdquo;
he said, after remaining silent for several
minutes. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you truly, I&rsquo;d rather
be kicked all the way down to Newtown and back
than to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you prefer I will write to Mr. Herrington
myself and explain why it is impossible for the
girls to enter the tournament,&rdquo; suggested Miss
Elting demurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; exclaimed George with strong emphasis.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite such a namby-pamby as
to hide behind a woman&rsquo;s skirts. I&rsquo;ll face the
music, I&rsquo;ll swallow my medicine and make a
maple syrup face while I&rsquo;m swallowing the bitter
stuff. I&rsquo;m going right down to-morrow and
have the disagreeable job over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His companions had also relapsed into their
former attitude of dejection. The full weight
of their disappointment came back with overwhelming
force.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_066">[066]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could talk without danger of cracking
my face. I&rsquo;d like to make a few remarks
just at this time,&rdquo; said Sam, talking as if he
had a hot potato in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try the sign language,&rdquo; suggested Dill
teasingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I will,&rdquo; mumbled Sam Crocker,
snatching up a pail of water and hurling it at
Dill, who succeeded in eluding all except a few
drops that rained over his head and down his
neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a sign of my displeasure. Want any
further signs? There are plenty of them left
over yonder in the spring, if the ladies will
kindly lend us the water pail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no more signs,&rdquo; replied Dill, backing
away, laughing. &ldquo;I would much prefer that you
remain quiet. Be as silent as a clam, if you like.
I&rsquo;ll not criticise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you wouldn&rsquo;t like the sign language
after you&rsquo;d felt it,&rdquo; snarled Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you say the tournament is to be
held?&rdquo; questioned Harriet mysteriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five weeks from to-day,&rdquo; answered George
Baker. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; He was eyeing her almost
suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been wanting something to do,
something to occupy our time and keep us out of
mischief, ever since we came up here to camp.
I have been thinking it over, thinking of your
<span class="pb" id="Page_067">[067]</span>
thoughtfulness and kindness, and for your
sakes, boys, I for one propose that we girls set
to work and learn the game. We surely ought to
be able to accomplish something in five weeks.
Don&rsquo;t you believe we can?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;you mean that you <i>will</i> play in
the tournament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeow!&rdquo; howled Captain George Baker, at
which his companions came running toward
him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going to play, they&rsquo;re going to
play!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Hi-diddie-um-dum, hi-diddie-um-dum!&rdquo;
he sang, dancing about as
though he had taken sudden leave of his senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, girls?&rdquo; questioned Harriet,
glancing about at her companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We say whatever you do. You are the captain
of the Meadow-Brook Girls just as Captain
Baker is captain of the Tramp Club,&rdquo; answered
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will play.&rdquo; Harriet nodded with
an emphasis that left no doubt as to her earnestness.
&ldquo;You shall teach us to play and we will
do the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we expect to be beaten badly,&rdquo;
sighed Hazel. &ldquo;But we shall make good your
entry for us, so that you boys will not be open to
any accusation except that of bad tennis judgment
and too great faith in the powers of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_068">[068]</span>
Meadow-Brook Girls,&rdquo; she added with a bright
little laugh.</p>
<p>Harriet Burrell sprang to her feet, eyes snapping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong!&rdquo; she flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; groaned George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll enter the tournament, but not to
lose. We&rsquo;ll enter to win, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic1">

<p class="center"><i>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll Enter to Win, Boys!&rdquo;</i></p>
</div>
<p>A few seconds of impressive silence followed
Harriet Burrell&rsquo;s bold declaration, then such a
shout rose from the throats of the boys of the
Tramp Club as perhaps never had been heard in
those woods before.</p>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br /><span class="small">ON THE SERVICE LINE</span></h2>
<p>Clasping hands, the Tramp Boys formed
a ring about Harriet, Sam among the
number, and danced and sang as they
swung about her, to all of which she protested
laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save your congratulations until after we
have practised for a few weeks. We shall be
better able to judge then what the prospects
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you said you were going to win,&rdquo; cried
Dill, excitedly. &ldquo;You know you did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_069">[069]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I still say so,&rdquo; returned Harriet Burrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t give us shivers up and down our
backs by such statements as &lsquo;save your congratulations,&rsquo;&rdquo;
advised Billy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll congratulate
now and cry later if we have to. Let&rsquo;s start
in practising at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night. The girls are getting supper.
Besides, it is too late in the day; they couldn&rsquo;t
see the ball,&rdquo; answered George. &ldquo;To-morrow,
too, Sam&rsquo;s nose will be better. He wouldn&rsquo;t enjoy
seeing a game now, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d enjoy seeing them play any old time, but
you&rsquo;ll excuse me if I get behind a tree somewhere
when the serving and the volleying are
going on. Once is enough for me, especially
when Sister Tommy is on the line. Come, fellows,
come home and get my supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please do, boys,&rdquo; urged Harriet. &ldquo;I
want to think. You will agree that we have
several things to think over between now and to-morrow,
and a number of things to talk over together,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Baker shook hands with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t try to tell you how much we appreciate
what you&rsquo;ve done,&rdquo; he said with feeling.
&ldquo;I knew all along that you could do it if
you would, but I had almost given up all hope
that you&rsquo;d try. I might have known you would.
Meadow-Brook Girls always come to the line
<span class="pb" id="Page_070">[070]</span>
when the time arrives. You will in this instance,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet smiled, but made no reply to this confident
remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, too, for fixing my nose,&rdquo; said
Sam, shaking hands with Miss Elting. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
pretty poor nose at its best, I know, but it&rsquo;s the
only one I have and I couldn&rsquo;t get along very
well without it. Good night, ladies. I&rsquo;ll say
more when I can do so without danger of damaging
my countenance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys trooped away singing. They were
far happier than they had been since George
Baker first broached the subject of the tennis
tournament. After the sound of their voices
had died away, Harriet sat down by the fire,
and, clasping her hands about her knees, gazed
into it without saying a word to her companions.
She remained in that position until the supper
call was sounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, have you planned it all out?&rdquo;
questioned Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far from it, Miss Elting. I am beginning
to realize that it is a pretty big thing I have
promised to do, and I shall need the help and encouragement
of every one of you girls even to
keep my spirits up to concert pitch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fiddlethtickth!&rdquo; scoffed Tommy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_071">[071]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think we have forgotten one important factor,&rdquo;
reminded Miss Elting; &ldquo;that is, the consent
of your parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have not overlooked that. I shall get
the consent of each girl&rsquo;s parents as soon as I
find there is any necessity for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guardian nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see how you can hope even to get a
place in the tournament. Tennis is a game of
skill requiring years to make one proficient, and
how you can expect to get into shape to play in
a tournament five weeks hence is beyond me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet laughed lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you offer objections. That
is exactly what I need to stir me up. That no
one else could hope to accomplish this thing is
the very reason why I have decided to attempt
it. And I, for one, am going to win,&rdquo; she added
reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I actually believe you think you will,&rdquo; exclaimed
the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. Otherwise I should not
try.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_072">[072]</div>
<p>Miss Elting regarded Harriet thoughtfully
for some time, then sighed and gave it up. Of
course, the subject was discussed among the
girls all the rest of the evening, Harriet most of
the time remaining in the background and listening
to the remarks of the guardian and her
own companions. The general trend of the conversation
was that the Meadow-Brook Girls
stood not even a ghost of a chance to win anything
in the tournament. They would be fortunate
if, after the first set, they were not barred
from further participation. Harriet had already
expressed her opinion and from that time
on her whole thought would be to play to win. If
she failed, it would be through no lack of belief
in herself, no lack of effort on her part to perfect
herself. She determined to turn her face
to the front and never once look back. That was
what she did on the following morning.</p>
<p>The boys came trooping in at an early hour,
but early as they were, the girls were ready for
them, with the morning work all cleared away
and Harriet and Hazel at work at the net industriously
tossing the ball back and forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea,&rdquo; declared George glowingly.
&ldquo;I told the boys we should find you at
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good morning, boys,&rdquo; greeted Harriet.
&ldquo;How is your poor nose this morning, Sam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all there still, but I can&rsquo;t smell with it
yet. Why, do you know my breakfast was
spoiled for me because I couldn&rsquo;t get the odor
of the bacon and coffee. I wish some one would
tell me how to smell through my mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll think about it to-night,&rdquo; answered Harriet
mischievously. &ldquo;I was going to suggest
<span class="pb" id="Page_073">[073]</span>
that you boys play a game of tennis while we
look on. I am sure we shall get some pointers
from your playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Elting, will you play a set with me?&rdquo;
asked George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, though I am but an indifferent
player.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you can handle a racquet as well as
I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us get at it. We have no time to
lose. Every minute is precious from now on for
the coming five weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George chose a racquet. They began to play
a few minutes later. It was plain that they were
evenly matched, though George appeared to be
a little more skilful than his opponent. The
girls were enthusiastic, the boys sitting on the
side lines offering suggestions to both players
from time to time. Harriet Burrell never spoke
a word throughout the game. Instead, she
watched every play with keen eyes, gaining no
little knowledge of the principles of the game
from such observation.</p>
<p>George won the first set by a narrow margin.
Miss Elting had made him work for it, fighting
him every inch of the way. While her playing
was good, it was not what might be called skilful.
She played such a game as might be expected
of a country player.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_074">[074]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Want to try another with me? No? Who
else wishes to put himself up as an easy mark
for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it&mdash;easy mark,&rdquo; chuckled Sam.
&ldquo;Any other kind would win the game before you
really got started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lucky for us that George isn&rsquo;t going to try
to defend the Meadow-Brook title,&rdquo; scoffed Dill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harriet, suppose you try a set with me this
morning?&rdquo; proposed George.</p>
<p>Harriet stepped forward. George, standing
beside her, gave her such advice as he was able,
regarding serving, volleying and position in the
court.</p>
<p>The game started, the boys and girls pressing
close about the court, not very much interested
in George Baker&rsquo;s playing, but watching eagerly
every stroke Harriet made. Was not she going
to play in the tournament? Harriet worked
hard, worked until the beads of perspiration
stood out on her forehead, but she was awkward,
she was uncertain in placing the ball, sending it
out of bounds fully as often as she dropped it
within reach of her opponent. George won
easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the worst I ever saw,&rdquo; declared
Sam very frankly. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t win a game
in a thousand years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet,&rdquo; commanded George. &ldquo;We
<span class="pb" id="Page_075">[075]</span>
can&rsquo;t all be champions the first day we stand before
a net. Give her a chance, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t mind Sam&rsquo;s criticism,&rdquo; answered
Harriet brightly. &ldquo;Instead of discouraging me,
it makes me all the more determined to learn to
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And only five weeks to learn in,&rdquo; groaned
Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a wooden man to teach her,&rdquo; mumbled
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any fellow who is so slow that he can&rsquo;t
dodge a racquet shouldn&rsquo;t criticise his betters,&rdquo;
retorted George cuttingly. &ldquo;Before we go any
further I shall deliver a lecture. The ladies will
please give their attention while I explain a few
of the terms. A &lsquo;volley,&rsquo; as you know, is hitting
the ball before it touches the ground. The
&lsquo;server&rsquo; is the one who hits the ball from behind
his base line and at one side of the center diagonally
over the net into his opponent&rsquo;s service
court. Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls nodded, but did not interrupt by
speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who serves the ball is called &lsquo;the
server,&rsquo; his opponent &lsquo;the striker-out.&rsquo; In the
first play, as I think I have already told you, the
ball must hit the ground before being returned.
The latter stroke is called a &lsquo;ground stroke.&rsquo;
There are some other fancy strokes that I have
<span class="pb" id="Page_076">[076]</span>
seen, but can&rsquo;t explain to you. I&rsquo;ll have some
one who knows more about the game than I do
tell you about these later on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we quite understand how the
scoring is done,&rdquo; said Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is easily explained. In the first place,
four points make a game unless the score is tied
at three points each, when two points in succession
must be secured to win the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are they scored?&rdquo; interjected Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to tell you,&rdquo; answered George.
&ldquo;They are scored as follows: &lsquo;love,&rsquo; or no
points; fifteen, or one point; thirty, or two
points; forty, or three points; game, or four
points. Love-all, fifteen-all, thirty-all are
called when the score is even, each side having
nothing or one or two points, as the case may be.
At forty-all the score is called &lsquo;deuce,&rsquo; each side
having three points, and as either side secures
the next point it becomes &lsquo;vantage-in&rsquo; or &lsquo;vantage-out&rsquo;
according to whether server or striker
has the advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grathiouth! you make my head thwim,&rdquo;
murmured Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the score hovers between vantage and
deuce until one side secures two points in succession,&rdquo;
explained Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed George, nodding. &ldquo;And six
games won by either side constitute a set unless
<span class="pb" id="Page_077">[077]</span>
the score is tied at five-all, when deuce-and-advantage
games are generally played, the score
going on up to six, seven, eight-all and so forth
until one side gets two successive games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it awful?&rdquo; wailed Margery. &ldquo;I never,
never can get all of that into my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ith becauthe you are fat,&rdquo; retorted
Tommy. &ldquo;You know a lot, don&rsquo;t you, George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he could play half as well as he can talk
about it, he&rsquo;d be the champion player of the
United States,&rdquo; declared Dill.</p>
<p>They began another game, Jane taking Harriet&rsquo;s
place this time. Jane was fully as awkward
as Harriet had been, but she made a
somewhat better showing, playing to better advantage.
Hazel and Tommy played the same
awkward game that had marked Harriet Burrell&rsquo;s
exhibition. One after another took her
place on the service line, over and over again,
this continuing all through the forenoon until
half-past eleven, when George announced that
they must go back to camp and get their noon
meal. They declined to stay to luncheon with
the girls. Besides, George said Fred Avery had
gone to town to bring some supplies that were
needed and they were to meet him at the camp.</p>
<p>George was gloomy all the way back to camp.
He did not speak a word to his companions, but
tramped along looking deeply dejected.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_078">[078]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of it?&rdquo; demanded
Dill quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I think of it? Hopeless&mdash;utterly
hopeless!&rdquo; groaned Captain George. &ldquo;Did you
ever see such work in all your life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did,&rdquo; agreed Dill. &ldquo;It was bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think they stand any show
to win any of the prizes in the tournament?&rdquo;
questioned Dodd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all. The way they play they couldn&rsquo;t
win a game from a team of six-year-old boys.
And what is worse, they don&rsquo;t realize what a
spectacle they are making of themselves trying
to play. But they&rsquo;re plucky. We all knew they
were. They will keep on fighting, and in the end
we shall have to tell them there isn&rsquo;t the least
show. I&rsquo;ll have to go to Herrington, after all,
and tell him that they can&rsquo;t enter the tournament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had some one who knew something to
teach them how to play, things might be different,&rdquo;
declared Sam Crocker maliciously.
&ldquo;Maybe a miracle will happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miracles don&rsquo;t happen in these woods. And
what&rsquo;s more, I want you to understand that I
know how to play tennis fully as well as you do.
It&rsquo;s hopeless, though. I wonder why Fred
hasn&rsquo;t got back yet? Go on and get your luncheon
ready. I don&rsquo;t want anything to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_079">[079]</div>
<p>George walked off into the woods and sat
down on a log, holding his head in his hands, now
and then uttering a deep sigh. It was he who
had proposed this surprise, he who had urged
upon the boys the purchase of the tennis outfit,
so he received no sympathy from them. But to
their credit be it said, the boys of the Tramp
Club felt as much concerned over the failure of
their well-laid plans as did Captain George
Baker himself.</p>
<p>George stuck to his determination not to eat
anything. He remained in the woods until long
after the boys had finished their luncheon and
had come to look for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going back for practice?&rdquo; asked
Billy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. What do you think I am?&rdquo; retorted
George savagely. But the afternoon was
destined to bring with it a surprise that set their
pulses throbbing, that filled them with new hope
and courage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_080">[080]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br /><span class="small">A CLOUD WITH A SILVER LINING</span></h2>
<p>As had been the case that morning, Harriet,
Jane, Hazel and Tommy were found at
work, the former two at the net, the latter
two some little distance away, tossing balls
back and forth with their racquets. The Meadow-Brook
Girls had made up their minds to
learn the game, and, still further, to learn to play
an expert game. Once having made up their
minds to a certain course of action they would
forge ahead, undaunted by any obstacles that
might be placed in their way. Bright eyes and
glowing faces encouraged even the morose Captain
Baker. He went so far as to smile his approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will get down to business again,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Harriet and Jane will please take their
places, Harriet to serve, Jane to be the striker-out.
Play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane began by losing her racquet, which fell
near the serving line in Harriet&rsquo;s court. That
was the beginning of the match, drawing suppressed
groans from the boys and laughter from
the girls.</p>
<p>Margery watched the practice indifferently.
<span class="pb" id="Page_081">[081]</span>
She declined even to practice. Tommy declared
that Buster was too fat to play tennis anyway,
and that it was fortunate for her companions
that she knew it. The game was resumed and
played out, Jane winning. There had not been
a moment of encouragement in it to the observers
on the boys&rsquo; side. Even Miss Elting had
frequently shaken her head, evidencing her
hopelessness of the girls ever accomplishing
anything at the game.</p>
<p>Hazel and Tommy played next. The little
lisping girl took a keener interest in her tennis
practice than they had ever known her to do in
anything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy is going to be an expert player one
of these days,&rdquo; declared Harriet. &ldquo;Which, however,
is more than can be said of some of her
companions. How do you think we are getting
along, George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t say so soon,&rdquo; answered George
evasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, George. You know you told the
boys to-day that we were hopeless,&rdquo; returned
Harriet laughingly.</p>
<p>George flushed to the roots of his hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody told you,&rdquo; flared Captain George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered nodding, her eyes snapping
mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Sam told you. I&rsquo;ll whale you for
<span class="pb" id="Page_082">[082]</span>
that when we get back to camp, Sam,&rdquo; threatened
George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sam did not tell me. You told me yourself,
Captain,&rdquo; chuckled Harriet. &ldquo;You told me
first by coloring when I accused you of it, then
you admitted it by word of mouth. You see, I
know you.&rdquo; Harriet laughed merrily, George&rsquo;s
companions joining in the laugh good-naturedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s too sharp for you, Captain,&rdquo; shouted
Dill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if I can&rsquo;t play tennis,&rdquo; answered Harriet.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m going to play tennis and I&rsquo;m
going to play it well. One of these days I shall
beat you, George, but I shall not forget that it
was you who taught me. Don&rsquo;t you think I
shall make a player? Answer me frankly. No
evasion, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&mdash;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t say just&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. There, I&rsquo;ve said it. You made
me do it, so don&rsquo;t blame me for saying so. I
don&rsquo;t believe there is the least little bit of use
in our going on with this. You might learn to
play the game, but you never, never will be expert
enough to go into a match game,&rdquo; he declared
with emphasis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you an encouraging boy, though?&rdquo;
jeered Jane. &ldquo;So glad you told us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_083">[083]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to understand that you are no longer
our instructor, George? If so, we had better
get some one else. I am quite certain that Sam
would be glad to teach us the game. Wouldn&rsquo;t
you, Sam?&rdquo; asked Harriet mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, seeing that my nose is out of commission,
I guess I&rsquo;d have to wear a mask. If I had
a mask and a coat of armor, I might be willing
to take a chance at teaching you. I guess the
Pickle had better do it, though. We can take
turns at it and as fast as one gets knocked out
another can take his place and go on with the
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you fellows make me weary,&rdquo; cried
George, springing up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you, Harriet.
I said I would, and I will. I guess, if you have
the pluck to stand up and keep batting away at
the balls without losing your nerve, I ought to
be willing to do my part, even if the tournament
is out of the question. We will go on with the
practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tommy smiled wisely at Jane, and the latter
chuckled under her breath. The practice was resumed,
this time with renewed vigor. Some
slight improvement was noted, though the great
difficulty seemed to be in getting the girls to
place the ball accurately. They seemed to be
unable to hit the ball so that it would fall in any
certain designated spot. Their strokes, too,
<span class="pb" id="Page_084">[084]</span>
were uneven. The ball was just as likely to fall
spinning on the volleyer&rsquo;s side of the net as into
the court of her opponent.</p>
<p>The technical name for this is &ldquo;a fault,&rdquo; and
means a score for the faulter&rsquo;s opponent. There
were many such, the faults being about even,
however, with little or no advantage for either
side. It was discouraging work, discouraging
for George Baker and discouraging for the girls,
though they did not show by their expression
that they were other than happy and contented
with their work. George found himself wondering
again if they really knew how badly they
played. He decided that they could not know,
or, with all their pluck, they would give it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gloom on our side of the camp is so
thick you can cut it with a bread-knife,&rdquo; thought
Sam after watching the game for the better part
of an hour. &ldquo;What spectacles they are making
of themselves, and&mdash;hooray! Good play. What&rsquo;s
the matter, Harriet? Did you forget yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had made a really brilliant play. To
their amazement, others equally as brilliant followed
it. Then all at once there came a slump.
Harriet Burrell played worse than ever. It had
come to the point where she could not even hit a
ball, much less deliver it properly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there were a lake handy, I&rsquo;d jump into it
and drown myself,&rdquo; George confided to Billy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_085">[085]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Go jump in the spring. A good ducking will
do you good. Your face is as red as a lobster.
You couldn&rsquo;t be any hotter if you had been playing
a championship game yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A championship game!&rdquo; groaned Baker.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything?&rdquo; demanded Sam,
coming up at that juncture.</p>
<p>George shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m a driveling idiot. I always knew
something was wrong with me, but until this
thing came up I never knew exactly what that
something was. Now I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;ve got a clear understanding of
yourself,&rdquo; answered Sam. &ldquo;It will be the best
thing ever for what ails you. But you were
mighty slow in getting wise to yourself. Even
Tommy could tell you. She could tell you what
you have done in this matter, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? What I have done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what have I done, that you haven&rsquo;t
done?&rdquo; demanded George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve bitten off more than you can chew,&rdquo;
answered Sam, with a series of cautious nods,
being wary of the bandages across his injured
nose. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; agreed George. &ldquo;So have you, so
have all the fellows. We are all in it up to our
<span class="pb" id="Page_086">[086]</span>
chins. What have you in the back of your head
besides what you&rsquo;ve just said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we ought to have a crack player to
teach those girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo; said Baker gravely, and with great
impressiveness, &ldquo;the champion player of the
world couldn&rsquo;t put any ginger or skill into the
playing of those young women, all of which isn&rsquo;t
saying a word against them, for I admire them
more than any lot of girls I ever knew, and so
do we all. Besides, there isn&rsquo;t any champion on
tap, so we must grub along with Captain George
Baker. Hello, there comes Fred Avery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter put down his bundles, wiped the
perspiration from his forehead, then, walking
over, tossed the morning paper to George.
Baker, hot and perspiring, sat down with his
back against a granite boulder and glanced idly
through the pages of the newspaper. All at
once he sprang to his feet and, waving the newspaper
frantically above his head, began to dance
about and yell as if he had suddenly gone crazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch him! Catch him!&rdquo; howled Sam.
&ldquo;Somebody catch him! He has hydrophobia!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it, I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; yelled George.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve <i>got it</i>! Saved, saved! Whoop! Yeow!
Oh, I was never so glad in my life. Yell, you
Indians, yell!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_087">[087]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br /><span class="small">A JOY AND A DISAPPOINTMENT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s all about, but I&rsquo;ll
yell,&rdquo; shouted Dill Dodd. He did. His
companions set up a perfect bedlam of
yells and howls.</p>
<p>The girls regarded them with puzzled looks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they gone crathy?&rdquo; questioned Tommy
apprehensively, ready to run the instant she
was thoroughly satisfied that the Tramp Boys
really had lost their minds. They had for the
moment lost their heads, but not their minds.
They were howling in sympathy with George
Baker, who appeared to have good reason for
all the noise he was making.</p>
<p>Miss Elting sat down and laughed heartily.
Then, bethinking herself of the fact that George
had been reading the paper at the time of his
outburst, she reached for the paper, which he
had by this time tossed aside, and began reading
the headlines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s there, it&rsquo;s there!&rdquo; howled George. &ldquo;I
tell you it&rsquo;s there. We&rsquo;re saved. The thing is
as good as done. Oh, who would have thought
it! I said there were no miracles that could
happen up in these woods. One has come to
<span class="pb" id="Page_088">[088]</span>
pass. Do you hear me? A miracle, and nothing
less!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row about, if I might pause long
enough to inquire?&rdquo; asked Sam Crocker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a piece of paper&mdash;quick!&rdquo; commanded
the captain. Harriet got a sheet of
writing paper from the tent, but not before
Tommy had handed him the newspaper. &ldquo;Yes,
it&rsquo;s writing paper I want. You&rsquo;ve a head on
your shoulders, Harriet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you considered me a hopeless
case,&rdquo; laughed Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think of you after I&rsquo;ve
got this off my mind. Oh, this is great!&rdquo;
George began scribbling on the sheet of writing
paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; agreed Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking your word
for it, you see, not having been let into the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the fastest runner in the outfit?&rdquo; demanded
Baker, standing up and glaring about
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gueth I am,&rdquo; answered Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a girl, I want a boy. Here,
Charlie Mabie, come here&mdash;on the jump. You
are the swiftest runner at hare and hounds, especially
when there&rsquo;s a square meal at the other
end. I want you to take this to Meadow-Brook
at top speed. If you fall down, don&rsquo;t stop to get
<span class="pb" id="Page_089">[089]</span>
up, just keep right on running. Run for your
life,&rdquo; commanded the captain breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;at shall I do with it when I get to
Meadow-Brook?&rdquo; questioned Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send it!&rdquo; exploded George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By mail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, by freight,&rdquo; drawled Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By telegraph, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it all about?&rdquo; demanded Dill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it. They won&rsquo;t understand anything
until you do read it. No, give it to me. You&rsquo;ll
stumble over it and waste time. Listen, you
people, to the telegram that is going to produce
the real thing. Listen, I tell you: &lsquo;You said you
would do anything on earth for me. If you
mean it, wire me that you are coming here on
the next train ready to serve me to the limit for
the next four weeks. It&rsquo;s a case of life and
death!&rsquo; Now, run, you Indian! Burn up the
road, and <span class="sc">WAIT</span> for an answer even if you have
to sleep on a baggage truck on the station platform.
<i>Go!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie Mabie started away at a long, loping
run, quickly crossing the open space and disappearing
in the forest beyond. Captain Baker
sat down heavily, wiping the perspiration from
his forehead with a sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! Never got such a shock in my life.
Think that will bring him? Well, I guess yes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_090">[090]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bring whom?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disbrow. Must I draw a diagram of the
whole thing?&rdquo; retorted the captain irritably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disbrow,&rdquo; reflected Sam. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all
right, but who is Disbrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Disbrow?&rdquo; groaned George. &ldquo;Never
hear of P. Earlington Disbrow? You mean to
say you never heard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a walking edition
of &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s Who,&rsquo;&rdquo; he reminded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all equally in the dark,&rdquo; interjected
Harriet. &ldquo;Why not explain to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, thith thuthpenthe ith terrible,&rdquo;
agreed Tommy with emphasis. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thtand
much more of thith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Baker made a helpless gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P. Earlington Disbrow,&rdquo; he began, with
slow, measured words, &ldquo;is an Englishman&mdash;an
Englishman from England. Get that, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam grinned and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P. Earlington Disbrow is one of the greatest
tennis players in the world, champion of all
England and half of the United States. <i>Now</i>
do you get me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; answered Sam, nodding understandingly.
&ldquo;This Disbrow fellow is an Englishman&mdash;from
England&mdash;and you&rsquo;ve sent for him to
come all the way over the ocean to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be quiet? No! He already is over
<span class="pb" id="Page_091">[091]</span>
the ocean. He is in New York, and I&rsquo;ve wired
him to come along a-whooping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he going to whoop for us at the tournament?&rdquo;
questioned Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may, though he isn&rsquo;t of the whooping
kind,&rdquo; replied the captain in a slightly modified
tone. &ldquo;I have sent for him to come here to teach
you girls to play tennis. If he can&rsquo;t do it, no
other person on earth can. Listen, and I&rsquo;ll read
the item from the newspaper: &lsquo;P. Earlington
Disbrow, the well-known tennis champion, arrived
in New York on the &ldquo;Caledonian&rdquo; yesterday.
When interviewed as to the purpose of
his visit to America, he denied that he had
come here for the purpose of arranging any
matches. Mr. Disbrow announces his intention
of visiting old friends, but wishes to witness the
mid-season tournaments, for most of which he is
ineligible.&rsquo; That is the whole story,&rdquo; finished
George. &ldquo;Are there any other questions you
wish to ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;d like to ask how you happen to have
such a pull with this fellow?&rdquo; questioned Sam.
&ldquo;Is it a real drag or are you doing it on your
nerve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an idea that Captain George knew
what he was doing when he sent that telegram,&rdquo;
spoke up Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Elting. I am pleased that
<span class="pb" id="Page_092">[092]</span>
some one takes me seriously. It is what Sam
calls &lsquo;a real drag.&rsquo; I didn&rsquo;t wish to say anything
about it. Two years ago I had the good
luck to be at Newport and to drag P. E. ashore
unconscious. A floating spar had hit him on
the head while he was swimming in the surf.
But I wasn&rsquo;t far away, so I just swam over and
dragged him ashore. That&rsquo;s the kind of a drag
it is, Samuel. P. E. naturally was grateful.
This is what he said: &lsquo;George, if you ever need
me, your Uncle Disbrow is at your command no
matter where he may be at the time. You send
for me and I&rsquo;ll be there as fast as steam and
lightning will take me.&rsquo; Not much of a drag,
eh?&rdquo; chuckled George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was so strong as that,&rdquo; muttered
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he may come here to coach us?&rdquo; wondered
Harriet. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that be perfectly
splendid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know whether he will or not,&rdquo; answered
Dill. &ldquo;P. E. may pay no attention to
George&rsquo;s telegram, then you will be up against
it just as hard as before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may not get the message, of course,&rdquo;
agreed George. &ldquo;But if it does reach him,
you mark what I say, we are sure to hear
from him. P. E. is a real man. Certain persons
who were opposed to him in matches didn&rsquo;t
<span class="pb" id="Page_093">[093]</span>
know this fact till they faced him across the nets;
then they found out in short order. Oh, he is the
right sort and you&rsquo;ll like him after you get to
know him as well as I do. Curious none of you
folks over heard of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; answered the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so have I,&rdquo; added Harriet. &ldquo;I have
read of his matches, both on this and the other
side of the Atlantic. What a glorious thing to
think that he may be here to instruct us! He
could show us how to win a match. By the way,
Captain Baker, how many will there be in our
class at the tournament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are all in your class&mdash;that is, eligible
for the same events. Of course, you girls will
play in doubles. For instance, you and Jane
will play together on a side with two other girls
opposed to you, while Hazel and Grace are playing
together on another court against another
pair of girls. If either of you win a certain
number of sets, whatever may be agreed upon
by the committee, then the winners play each
other. Doesn&rsquo;t sound so very formidable, does
it?&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough so,&rdquo; answered Harriet Burrell
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well go on with our practice.
Can&rsquo;t afford to waste any time, you know,&rdquo; reminded
George. They took up their work with
<span class="pb" id="Page_094">[094]</span>
new courage, and all during that afternoon the
girls worked steadily and to better purpose than
at any time before.</p>
<p>They had just stopped playing for the day
when Charlie Mabie came trotting into camp.
He was waving a yellow sheet over his head.
He had been fortunate enough to get a ride in
an automobile both going and coming and so
had returned early.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got it!&rdquo; yelled George. The captain
sprang forward and snatched the telegram from
the hands of his messenger. &ldquo;Whoop! I told
you so. Listen to this, ladies of the Meadow-Brook
organization and gentlemen of the Tramp
Club, listen to what the champion of England
says in reply to George Baker&rsquo;s telegram:
&lsquo;Coming, you bet! Meet me seven-thirty to-morrow
morning. (Signed) Earlington Disbrow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I the original provider?&rdquo; demanded the
captain triumphantly.</p>
<p>The boys of the Tramp Club tossed their hats
in the air, uttering a series of wild whoops, to
which was added the yell of the Meadow-Brook
Girls.</p>
<p>The entire party was wild with delight over
the good news and Captain Baker was more a
hero than ever before. While Harriet and Hazel
were getting the supper, to which the boys
<span class="pb" id="Page_095">[095]</span>
had been invited, the others passed the time in
song and general congratulation. It was a
merry camp.</p>
<p>George and one of his companions were to go
to Meadow-Brook early in the morning to meet
the champion tennis player at half-past seven
o&rsquo;clock. Jane suggested that she, too, go in and
bring the visitor back in her car. This Miss Elting
did not approve. George said it would be
unnecessary, that he could get some one to drive
out with them. It was, therefore, arranged that
way, and the boys left their friends shortly before
ten o&rsquo;clock that evening, filled with anticipation
for the morrow.</p>
<p>A start was made next morning before daylight,
George and Charlie setting out on foot
for the village, more than ten miles away. However,
they did not in the least mind the long
walk. They were too well used to tramping over
the country.</p>
<p>The girls fairly counted the hours next morning.
They calculated that George and his friend
should reach the camp in the woods no later than
half-past nine o&rsquo;clock. The camp had been put
in perfect order for the guest, and the Tramp
Boys in their own camp had set aside a small
tent for Disbrow, making the interior of the
tent as comfortable as possible. If he thought
best after reaching the camp to transfer operations
to the village, this could be very easily accomplished.
They did not know how well
pleased he might be with the discomforts of life
in camp there in the woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_096">[096]</div>
<p>Half-past nine passed, then ten. At noon
there was still no sign of George and his friend.
The girls sat down to their noon meal, which
they had hoped to share with Disbrow. The
boys refused to eat with them. The former
were becoming gloomy. They felt that something
must have occurred to detain the party at
Meadow-Brook, but what that something might
be they were unable to imagine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes some one,&rdquo; shouted Sam suddenly,
while the girls were still at their meal.</p>
<p>Everybody sprang up. Just emerging from
the log road that led into their camp clearing
they saw Captain George Baker. The captain
had lost his former springiness of step, his alert
manner. He was dragging himself along as
though worn out with fatigue. Charlie Mabie
was not with him. Neither was the expected
guest, P. Earlington Disbrow, the tennis champion
of all England and part of the United
States.</p>
<p>The boys ran forward to meet George, the
girls following more slowly. Harriet knew from
George Baker&rsquo;s attitude that something was
wrong. His dejection was apparent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_097">[097]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he? What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; shouted
Billy.</p>
<p>George waved the boys aside, and stumbling
into camp leaned heavily against a sapling.
The Tramp Boys and the Meadow-Brook Girls
gathered about him, gazing at Captain George
with eyes heavy with anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; groaned George. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ended,
like the Englishman&rsquo;s sparrow, gone up the
blooming spout. Don&rsquo;t ever speak to me of it
again; don&rsquo;t ever mention tennis nor tournament
nor Disbrow nor anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if you were to tell us what it is all
about we might offer some suggestions,&rdquo; said
Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late, Miss Elting. I tell you it&rsquo;s finished.
Read that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust a yellow sheet toward her, the girls
recognizing it to be a telegraphic message. The
guardian read it hurriedly, then she, too, sat
down heavily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_098">[098]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br /><span class="small">A BLOW THAT NEARLY KILLED GEORGE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame you for feeling disturbed,
George,&rdquo; comforted the guardian,
&ldquo;but there is still a ray of hope left
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begging your pardon, there isn&rsquo;t even a
glimmer,&rdquo; returned George. &ldquo;I might have
known something would be sure to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I see it?&rdquo; asked Harriet. Miss Elting
handed the message to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it aloud,&rdquo; cried Dill. &ldquo;George doesn&rsquo;t
seem to think any one is interested except himself.
What&rsquo;s the matter with Disbrow? When
is he coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t coming at all,&rdquo; answered George
weakly. &ldquo;Please read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;George Baker, Meadow-Brook, N. H.&rsquo; It
is dated at New London,&rdquo; explained Harriet,
then continued to read the message, which was
as follows: &ldquo;&lsquo;Unfortunate accident. Pullman
step porter set down tilted under foot when I
was stepping from train. Landed on back with
sprained ankle. Laid up perhaps two weeks.
Awfully sorry. See what I can do if come here.
Let know any change. (Signed) Disbrow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_099">[099]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Must have thought he was writing a letter
instead of sending a telegram,&rdquo; jeered Crazy
Jane.</p>
<p>The boys glanced at each other and breathed
deeply. Words failed them just at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sprained his ankle and is laid up,&rdquo; reflected
Jane. &ldquo;He asks you to come to see him.
Are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not go on our account,&rdquo; said
Harriet Burrell. &ldquo;You must not worry him
with our troubles. He has plenty of his own at
present. We shall get along somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, don&rsquo;t take it so to heart, George,&rdquo; urged
the guardian. &ldquo;We are fortunate in having
you to coach us. I know you will turn us out finished
players at the expiration of five weeks
from the time we started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mr. Mabie?&rdquo; asked Hazel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left him in town, in case there should happen
to be anything more from Disbrow. But
there won&rsquo;t be. I know what a sprained ankle
is. I had one once, and I don&rsquo;t want another.
What a mess I have made of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you have not,&rdquo; returned Harriet
quickly. &ldquo;You have done a great deal for us.
That you have failed in this one instance is no
fault of your own. Circumstances have been
too much for you, that is all. We shall never
forget what you have done for us. We are the
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
ones who have not measured up to the mark, but
you will remember I told you we were going to
play in the tournament and going to win. I say
it again. We are going to <span class="sc">WIN</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to play a better game than you
have done so far,&rdquo; George blurted, then, realizing
what he had said, made an humble apology
for his apparent rudeness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; Harriet laughed merrily.
&ldquo;We shall have to play a much better game, and
that is what we are going to do. But we are
wasting time. Girls, get ready for practice.
Captain, you sit on the boulder yonder from
where you can watch us. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to
criticise. We need your severest criticism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls ran for their racquets, Sam got the
tennis balls, George pulled himself together and
stumbled over to the boulder, on which he took
his seat, but instead of watching the girls, he
sunk his head in his hands and relapsed into his
former gloomy mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; said Sam, giving the captain a poke
in the ribs with a thumb, &ldquo;look at those girls.
We aren&rsquo;t going to be quitters, are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>George hesitated a moment, then raised his
head, threw back his shoulders and slid from the
rock to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Sam. For once in your life
you are talking sense. Of course we&rsquo;ll go on. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
was so bitterly disappointed about Disbrow that
I lost my courage. I&rsquo;ve found it again. If we
fail now, it won&rsquo;t be because we didn&rsquo;t try. Prepare
for the first set. No fooling now. Harriet
and Tommy will play together this time, opposing
Jane and Hazel. We shall see what you can
do in team work. This will be the regular set
provided you can stand it to play that long without
a rest. It is time we did some grilling.&rdquo;
George was himself again. Harriet smiled and
nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do not hesitate to say what you
think,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;We are not so sensitive
that we cannot stand listening to the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly every play for the first half of the set
was a fault. George groaned within himself, but
was careful not to show how hopeless he felt
inwardly. He worked with them until the perspiration
was trickling down his cheeks, until
he was well-nigh exhausted from the nervous
strain.</p>
<p>Along in the fourth game, however, matters
began to brighten a little. Harriet and Tommy
made some very good strokes. Tommy showed
herself to be very quick on her feet, though there
was no certainty as to where she was going to
place a ball when she struck it. It was just as
likely to soar off among the bushes and be lost
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
as it was to drop in the court of her opponents.
Jane developed no little power in her strokes,
but her footwork was poor, yet a keen judge
would have discovered good tennis material in
each of the girls at the net. George, of course,
was not an expert, and these little surface indications
of possibilities were lost on him. He saw
only faults or scores. Anything less than the
latter sent his heart down into his boots, figuratively
speaking.</p>
<p>Harriet and Tommy won the set handily,
though the last game of the set was worse played
than any game since they had been practising.
If anything, George was more discouraged than
at any previous time. Tommy, however, was
delighted with her own playing. The little lisping
girl considered that she and Harriet had
played a wonderful game, merely because they
had defeated Jane and Hazel.</p>
<p>They were given no time in which to discuss
the game. Their instructor changed sides, placing
Hazel and Harriet together, Jane and
Tommy opposed to them. Harriet and Hazel
won the set, the former&rsquo;s fast playing, though
full of faults, being responsible for her side getting
the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are showing speed, at any rate,&rdquo; was
George&rsquo;s compliment. &ldquo;If I were a better
coach, I might be able to push you along faster,
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
but this is the first time I ever tried to teach
any one to play tennis. I wish Disbrow were
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, forget Disbrow!&rdquo; answered Sam. &ldquo;We
are going to win out in this tournament. I believe
with Harriet that there isn&rsquo;t another team
on the coast that can defeat this one. They are
only amateurs, girls. Probably many of them
are beginners, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you fool yourself about that,&rdquo; returned
Baker. &ldquo;Herrington told me they had
a lot of likely entries, almost professional players,
though, of course, they are not that in fact.
One thing I wish to call the attention of the
players to, is that Jane and Tommy played too
far apart. Tommy took a position down near
the net while Jane was back near the serving
line. You saw how Harriet and Hazel played,
both back some distance from the net. They
won the game. Remember, it is easier to run
forward and pick up a ball than it is to run backward.
Play closer together and you will put
up a much better defence and run less risk of
the ball passing you. Try it this time, playing
closer together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>They did, with the result that the game was
much closer than the one before, though Harriet
Burrell&rsquo;s side won as usual. Just why her side
always won George Baker was at a loss to understand,
for it was plain that Harriet played a
wretched game, worse, if anything, than did her
companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please tell me how you did it?&rdquo;
questioned George after Harriet&rsquo;s side had won
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not do it. Tommy and I did it together,&rdquo;
was the naive reply. But Harriet,
awkward and unscientific as she was, had used
some little trick that got the better of her opponents.
They did not appear to realize this,
but Harriet did. She knew full well, and that
trick was a phase of the game that she proposed
to cultivate and work to the limit. She was very
sorry that they were not to be coached by Mr.
Disbrow, knowing that he could be of great assistance
to her in developing this very trick.
Disbrow would have understood instantly the
value of it.</p>
<p>The play was continued with more or less
discouraging results, so far as Baker was concerned,
all the afternoon, with only an occasional
halt for rest and such instruction as the
coach was able to give them. At sundown he
threw himself down on the ground, his face red
and perspiring, his throat hoarse from yelling
at his pupils, his body weary. It was the hardest
day&rsquo;s work that George Baker had ever
done, but the nervous strain was the cause of
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
his great fatigue rather than the physical effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, fellows, we must be getting to our
own wigwam,&rdquo; he said, starting up suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to remain here and have supper,&rdquo;
replied Miss Elting. &ldquo;You were quite
willing to be with us last evening when the
skies were bright. Now that they are not
bright it is all the more reason why you should
stay this time. You are all fagged out and, what
is worse, discouraged. We shall have a nice
supper this evening, then afterward some songs
and games if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more games for me to-day,&rdquo; interrupted
George, &ldquo;begging your pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not mean tennis games. I, too, have
seen enough of those for one day. I meant other
games that will relax you all. Songs are a good
thing. Our players will &lsquo;go stale&rsquo; with too much
work. It is not a good plan, I have heard, to
keep too steadily at it when one is preparing for
a contest. Am I not right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>George nodded. Sam smiled broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we must take care of our principals,&rdquo;
declared the latter. &ldquo;They are very delicate
and very precious.&rdquo; This raised the first laugh
of that long, trying afternoon. The boys checked
their own laughter suddenly, as if they had
caught themselves doing something wrong.
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
Harriet started the Meadow-Brook yell, in
which the boys joined with a shout. From that
moment on the gloom of the day was less
marked, conversation more natural and easy.</p>
<p>When the supper was served on a table that
the boys had made for them, they all sat down on
rustic seats put together by the same skilful
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, isn&rsquo;t this better than for you boys to
go back to camp to mope all the evening while
we girls are doing the same here?&rdquo; demanded
the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; this has the other backed off the court,
over the side lines into the bushes,&rdquo; declared
Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otherwise, nothing but slang would quite fit
the occasion, eh, Mr. Crocker?&rdquo; chuckled Miss
Elting. &ldquo;I am not rebuking you. I have never
had and never expect to have occasion to do
that to a Tramp Boy. How long is Mr. Mabie
to remain in town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him to stay there until P. E. either
telegraphed or wrote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think there is some prospect of his coming,
then, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one chance in a million,&rdquo; answered
George with emphasis. &ldquo;Would you, if you had
a sprained ankle? I reckon he will make the
Pullman Company pay very dearly for this,
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
though. The ankle of a tennis player is worth
something, I should say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the girls&rsquo; playing
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some ways it is an improvement,
but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But! There is just the trouble,&rdquo; cried Harriet.
&ldquo;When we do our best you say, &lsquo;It is very
good, but&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he demanded a little sourly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not permitted myself to think of the
matter in that way,&rdquo; replied Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have given up hope so far as the
tournament is concerned?&rdquo; questioned the guardian,
fixing a steady look on the face of the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I should hardly care to say that,&rdquo; stammered
George, avoiding her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But deep down in your heart you do not believe
the Meadow-Brook Girls stand the slightest
chance of winning even a place in the tennis
tournament at Newtown?&rdquo; persisted the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; returned George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am asking you, Captain Baker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. There, you made me say it
again. Now will you tell me what you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I should put it quite so
strongly as you have, but from what we have
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
seen I should say the chances were not particularly
brilliant,&rdquo; she admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are tho encouraging!&rdquo; lisped Tommy.
&ldquo;Anybody who can play thuch a game ath I
can to be talked about in that way! It maketh
me thad, tho thad and tho tired!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One person cannot play for the whole team,
you know,&rdquo; said Dill, with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, I thuppothe that ith tho. However, I
will do jutht ath the otherth withh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say to giving it up, girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Elting was not smiling now, though, had
they been more observant, they would have seen
a suggestion of laughter in her eyes. She knew
her girls well, and perhaps was asking the question
with a deeper purpose in mind than appeared
on the surface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say just what I have said before,&rdquo; answered
Harriet slowly and with emphasis. &ldquo;I
have gone into this not for the sake of giving up,
but with the purpose to go through with it. We
owe it to the boys who have done so much for us
to keep going until the end. That is what I
propose to do unless I am forbidden by Miss Elting
or by my parents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t win,&rdquo; cried George. &ldquo;You
know you can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do if I win?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take off my hat to you, even though I
get a sunstroke doing it,&rdquo; returned George, his
face relaxing into a broad smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have the chance, for I am going
to play and I am going to win. The team is
going to win. That is what I mean when I say
I am going to do it. Of course, I do not expect
to do it alone. I know we are going to win a
place. I feel it. I can&rsquo;t tell you just why, but I
do, so you had better prepare to protect yourself
from sunstroke. If there are any trees
where the tournament is to be held, by all means
engage a place under one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have trees near tennis courts.
Trees throw shadows that sometimes make the
players nervous or cause them to misjudge their
distances. No, I&rsquo;ll have to take my medicine
and I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; Jane held up a hand for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Sam, with a half startled
look in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard some one speak. It may have been
out in the road, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One couldn&rsquo;t hear as far as that. Besides,
I am sure I heard a call,&rdquo; declared Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one surely is coming. I hear two
voices,&rdquo; agreed Miss Elting. &ldquo;Perhaps it is
Charlie Mabie returning from the village with
good news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be Charlie Mabie all right, but there
is nothing doing on the good news,&rdquo; replied
George.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, there! Hello the camp!&rdquo; called the familiar
voice of Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello yourself,&rdquo; answered George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out and help me, some of you strong-armed
boys. I have picked up a fellow who has
hurt his foot. Can&rsquo;t you give a poor suffering
chap a hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys sprang up, George with them. In
the dim light they could faintly make out two
figures approaching them. One was Mabie, the
other no one recognized. The latter was leaning
on Charlie&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Owdy, Georgie, old chap?&rdquo; called a second
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What-a-at?&rdquo; gasped Captain Baker. &ldquo;Who
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, old chap? Have you forgotten
an old friend so soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s P. E.! It&rsquo;s P. E. himself! Whoop!&rdquo;
Captain Baker uttered a wild yell and rushing
forward threw his arms about the neck of the
newcomer. &ldquo;Oh, P. E., P. E., you did come after
all; you didn&rsquo;t go back on your old salt water
friend! Girls, he&rsquo;s here, he&rsquo;s here, I tell you!
Yell, you Tramps! Yell, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br /><span class="small">A GUEST WHO WAS WELCOME</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;It is Mr. Disbrow!&rdquo; gasped Hazel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he didn&rsquo;t sprain his ankle at
all,&rdquo; added Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have injured it, for he is walking
with a crutch,&rdquo; replied Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word, Disbrow. Come over here and
sit down and fix your foot so it will be comfortable.
You may tell us all about it later on. Sam,
fix a seat there for P. E. Somebody put down
his coat for P. E. to sit on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newcomer was laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George, I&rsquo;m not quite in swaddling clothes,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;nor am I wholly an invalid. Please
introduce me to your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Baker flushed, for, in his joy at seeing
Disbrow, he had neglected the formalities. He
introduced the guest first to Miss Elting, then to
the Meadow-Brook Girls and afterward to the
boys of the Tramp Club. Harriet had already
begun making coffee and was preparing a luncheon
for the unexpected guest, who had had no
supper as they afterward learned. He was given
a place at the end of the table where he might
stretch his injured foot. With all the girls and
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
boys gathered about him watching each mouthful
that the champion ate, Disbrow did full justice
to the supper, for he was hungry. During
the meal he explained that the doctors who had
examined his ankle at the hospital had first pronounced
it a serious sprain, after which they
had revised their opinion, finding it merely a
slight strain which, within a few days, would
entirely disappear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost no time in hot-crutching it out to
Meadow-Brook,&rdquo; added the Englishman. &ldquo;I
knew that you wouldn&rsquo;t have said what you did
in your message unless you needed me. Mr.
Mabie spotted me the instant I got down from
the car. But, George, old chap, I don&rsquo;t think
much of your conveyances up this neck of
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We rode out on a lumber wagon,&rdquo; explained
Charlie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and every joint in my body was properly
shaken loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Elting at this juncture called George
aside and suggested that arrangements be made
for Mr. Disbrow to remain at the Meadow-Brook
camp that night on account of his lame ankle.
George assented and sent two of his fellows to
the Tramp camp to fetch the tent they had set
aside for Disbrow.</p>
<p>The girls had hung upon the champion&rsquo;s every
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
word and gesture since his arrival at the camp.
But they had difficulty in making themselves believe
that this man was the much-heralded
champion. Disbrow was thin, pale and delicate
looking. His movements were slow and deliberate
and he was what Jane characterized as
&ldquo;fussy.&rdquo; But he was Disbrow, the champion
tennis player. There could be no doubt as to
that. George knew. Yet it did seem almost impossible.</p>
<p>Having finished his supper, Disbrow, with the
aid of his crutch, hobbled about pluckily, testing
the strength of the strained ankle. They
suggested that he stop. He said the ankle would
be lame just so long as it was babied, that he
proposed to throw away his crutch on the following
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, old chap, tell me what it is all about?&rdquo;
urged the champion after having resumed his
seat at the end of the table. &ldquo;Charlie told me
something of what you wanted of me, but he
was too excited to be clear about it. It is some
sort of a match game of tennis that you young
ladies are wanting to take part in, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coast championship,&rdquo; George informed
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the young ladies, they are good players?&rdquo;
questioned the tennis champion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We practically never touched a racquet until
within a few days ago,&rdquo; said Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m-m! How are they playing,
George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As badly as possible!&rdquo; answered the captain
with emphasis, whereat there was a shout
of laughter from the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Baker has described it correctly,&rdquo; added
Harriet. &ldquo;Please let me explain the situation.
Our young friends, the Tramp Club, as they call
themselves, entered the Meadow-Brook Girls in
the Atlantic Coast Tennis Tournament, supposing,
of course, that we played, and played well.
None of us play tennis, but for the sake of showing
them that we appreciated their efforts, we
promised to go in and do the best we could. Understand,
Mr. Disbrow, they had bought a net, a
complete outfit and carried it up here in order
that we might have opportunity to practice.
We have been doing so under Captain Baker&rsquo;s
instruction, but I fear we have not played in a
manner to encourage him very much. The captain
said you could whip us into shape if any
one could do so. He was overjoyed when he saw
in a newspaper a notice of your arrival in this
country. I think you know the rest. We were
very unhappy when we learned of your accident.
I think that is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except to express our appreciation of your
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
kindness in coming here, crippled as you are,&rdquo;
added the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing, Miss Elting. I would do a lot
more for George, and now that I have met you
and your young ladies, I thank him for sending
for me. How many of you are there, Miss Elting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are five young women and myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how many will play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four, I believe. Miss Brown doesn&rsquo;t care
to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Buthter ith&mdash;&rdquo; began Tommy, casting
a tantalizing look at Margery.</p>
<p>Harriet nudged Tommy to be silent. The
girls were trying their best to keep from laughing
at the little lisping girl&rsquo;s attempted fling at
Margery, whose face had grown very red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when is this tournament to take place?&rdquo;
questioned the Englishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little less than five weeks from now,&rdquo; answered
George.</p>
<p>Disbrow uttered a low whistle under his
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you expect to win something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we do,&rdquo; replied Harriet Burrell
promptly. &ldquo;Otherwise we should not have decided
to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disbrow regarded her shrewdly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You at least have the proper spirit. Other
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
things being equal, you ought to win. But you
must remember that tennis is not a game to be
learned in a day. Years ordinarily are required
to make the expert player. I am not going to
say that I think you have no chance. I can not
say until I have seen you play. To-morrow we
shall see what you can do. For my part, I shall
do my best for you. It follows that I am able to
coach to the best advantage, but first of all you
must be tennis players by instinct. Even were
you fair players, you would have a task before
you to prepare yourself for a tournament within
the short time left. George, will this tournament
call out any high-class material?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Herrington says it will, especially the Scott
Sisters from Portsmouth, who are said to be
near the professional class. I don&rsquo;t know of my
own knowledge how well they play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm-m-m. Not a very encouraging outlook,
is it, young ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had any reason to change my mind
as to the result,&rdquo; remarked Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you expect to win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That state of mind should go a long way toward
the success of your club. All of you feel
the same way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We always agree with Harriet,&rdquo; answered
Hazel, with an emphatic nod.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A jolly good idea,&rdquo; muttered the Englishman,
regarding each girl with a steady gaze of
keen inquiry. He was noting their movements,
their poise, with the eyes of an expert. This
brief study encouraged P. Earlington Disbrow.
He decided that the Meadow-Brook Girls were
at least good material, but as for fitting themselves
to play in a tournament at such short notice,
he was doubtful, and they saw that he was.
This did not change the point of view of the
Meadow-Brook Girls in the least, but it added
to the gloom of Captain Baker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another matter that I wish to mention,&rdquo;
said Miss Elting. &ldquo;We cannot give you any
comforts up here in the woods. Perhaps you
would prefer to have us move into town,
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; replied the guest. &ldquo;We
should have a crowd at our heels all the time.
I don&rsquo;t mind saying that I purpose showing you
some things about tennis that I would be chary
of other persons knowing. These things are
what a merchant would characterize as his stock
in trade. I&rsquo;d be a proper idiot to give them
away to others, wouldn&rsquo;t I, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They agreed that he would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may depend upon our discretion,&rdquo; the
guardian assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that. It is unnecessary to tell me.
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
Do I have far to go to get to your camp,
George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to remain here to-night, Mr. Disbrow,&rdquo;
replied the guardian. &ldquo;Two of the boys
have gone to their camp to bring a tent for you.
We shall make you as comfortable as possible,
but it will not be exactly home comforts, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am used to roughing it. I&rsquo;ve played tennis
pretty much all over the world and have had
to put up with some pretty rough quarters. I&rsquo;m
jolly well satisfied with a tent and a pair of clean
blankets. This supper, let me tell you, I enjoyed
more than anything I&rsquo;ve had since I left
England. I shall have to be careful or I&rsquo;ll put
on too much flesh in the two or three weeks I am
up here. By the way, what is the physical condition
of the young ladies, Miss Elting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not see how it could be better,&rdquo; answered
the guardian. &ldquo;They practically live
out-of-doors a good part of the year. I should
say that their endurance is as great as it is possible
to find in a woman, if that is what you
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded reflectively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I judged as much from the little I have seen
of them. I trust you to see to it that they do not
overdo nor &lsquo;go stale&rsquo; before the date set for the
match. An ambitious person is quite likely to
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
try to do too much. He pays for it bitterly in
many cases. But we shall see after a day or so.
To-morrow morning I wish to see the young
ladies play. You naturally will play in doubles
at the tournament, so that is the way I shall
have you play to-morrow. Until then I can say
nothing definite as to what we shall do. How
are their strokes, George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awkward,&rdquo; answered the captain frankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the fault of their teacher. You
haven&rsquo;t taught them properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did the best I could,&rdquo; replied George bitterly,
&ldquo;but it did not seem to me to be of
much use. I am no tennis sharp, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have you depreciating yourself that
way, Captain,&rdquo; declared Miss Elting warmly.
&ldquo;He has done nobly by us,&rdquo; she added to Mr.
Disbrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it isn&rsquo;t his fault that we have made so
little progress,&rdquo; agreed Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the court?&rdquo; inquired the young
Englishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As good as I could make. I&rsquo;ve played on
worse ones,&rdquo; answered the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to look into that, too. It&rsquo;s an
important factor, and conditions on the practice
court must be as near a duplicate of those on
which the tournament is to be played as possible.
Will they be grass or dirt courts?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dirt, so Herrington said. This one is dirt
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think when that tent is ready I will
retire. How about it, Brother George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is up. The fellows are making your bed
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How thoughtless in me! I shall attend to
that myself,&rdquo; said the guardian, rising hurriedly
and going to the tent that the boys had
set up some little distance from the Meadow-Brook
camp. Shortly after that Mr. Disbrow
retired to his tent. The boys saw him safely
stowed there, then left for their own camp.</p>
<p>The next day was to be a day of activity, a
day of hopes and disappointments which were
destined to have an important bearing on the
outcome of their plans.</p>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br /><span class="small">IN THE HANDS OF A MASTER</span></h2>
<p>The Englishman was out early the next
morning. The girls found him hobbling
about with a stick, he having cast his
crutch aside. It was plain that he was a very
resolute young man, who intended to begin his
task with a will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>The Tramp Boys came over shortly after Disbrow
had finished his breakfast with the Meadow-Brook
Girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the first thing on the program,
P. E.?&rdquo; questioned George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing is to make the court usable.
At present it is hopeless. If you will have your
boys get to work on it, we may be able to have a
try-out some time this afternoon. Got anything
to mark the lines with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I forgot the chalk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any flour in the camp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Elting said there was. Disbrow said
that when the court had been leveled off he
would mark out the side lines and base lines
with the flour, after which the girls would play
a game for him. All that forenoon the boys
worked at their task, and by luncheon time had
done all the champion had suggested. The
court, he said, was still in almost impossible
shape, but that it was the best that could be had
at that moment.</p>
<p>The hour following the luncheon was spent in
conversation, after which Disbrow told the
young women to go on the court and play out
a set. At first they were nervous with the champion
watching them, but after the first two
games of the set their confidence returned, their
nervousness disappeared and they went at their
work with a vim. George chewed his hat brim
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
nervously as they floundered about the court,
but the face of the Englishman was impassive.
He watched keenly, making no comment, but
storing up data in his mind to be used later on
when he should have really begun his instruction.
Tommy and Harriet were playing together
against Hazel and Jane, which arrangement
the champion changed in the last half of
the set.</p>
<p>The set came to an end suddenly through a
fault of Jane&rsquo;s, and the girls, flushed and excited,
turned to their new instructor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we to play another game?&rdquo; questioned
Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of them?&rdquo; asked George
in a hesitating voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too early to think, old chap. Better reserve
the thinking for another time. There is
work to be done now. I wonder if I should
break my neck if I were to play a game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not try it,&rdquo; answered the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will. I&rsquo;ll play against you and&mdash;who
is your best player?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlie is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take your places. We won&rsquo;t toss for
sides. There isn&rsquo;t any choice so far as I can
see. You will excuse me if I use my stick to
assist me. I will permit your side to serve. That
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
will give you the advantage at the beginning. I
probably shall make an exhibition of myself.
What I want you young ladies to observe is my
method of delivery. My position will be nothing
to be proud of, playing on one leg, as I shall
have to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear it will not be prudent for you to try,&rdquo;
said Miss Elting, with a shake of her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get myself into shape in order to
coach the Meadow-Brook team properly. Now
that I have started, I shall go through with it.
How could I do otherwise after being made acquainted
with the pluck of your young charges!
Let it come, old chappie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George served the ball. Disbrow hopped on
one leg, making a leap half-way across the court,
scooping up the ball after its first bound, as
the rules require. It slipped past George and
Charlie really before they realized that it was
on the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love, fifteen,&rdquo; sang out the Englishman.
&ldquo;You will have to do better than that, my lads,
or it wouldn&rsquo;t do for you to try to play opposite
the young ladies. Love, thirty. Why, what ails
you, boys? You aren&rsquo;t playing tennis, you are
merely watching your opponent play.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>The Englishman was hopping from one side
of the court to the other, in the air, it seemed,
fully as much as he was on the ground. Disbrow
out of a court and Disbrow in a court were
two wholly different personalities. The Meadow-Brook
Girls began to understand why he was
a champion. They revised their earlier opinions
about his being delicate and slow. His movements
when occasion required were lightning-like
in their rapidity, then with a languid movement
of his racquet he would drop the ball just
over the net, many feet from where Charlie and
Captain George were waiting to receive it.
Wherever they were not, there went the tennis
ball. The Englishman outplayed them at every
point.</p>
<p>The girls became so excited over the game
that they simply could not keep still. They applauded
till their hands stung and smarted, they
shouted until their voices grew husky. They
had never seen the like of this, and now that
they had begun to understand the game of
tennis, they were able to appreciate many of the
fine plays. It was the grace and ease of the
player at all times that aroused their wonder.
He appeared to work without the slightest effort,
even with the handicap of a foot that would
not bear his weight. The tennis ball, too, seemed
endowed with reasoning powers, it seemed to
change its course after leaving the racquet of
the server when an opponent got in the way.
This they could not understand, neither could
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
the other spectators, for they had never seen
anything like it in all their experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Game!&rdquo; announced the Englishman. &ldquo;Keep
right on playing. We will go through the set.
See to it that you don&rsquo;t loaf. Play tennis; don&rsquo;t
stand there and watch me serve. Show the
young ladies that you at least know how to
play the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I know how. They know that
without my showing them. But what can you
expect a couple of amateurs to do against the
champion of all England and half the United
States of America? Charlie, watch yourself,&rdquo;
he added in a whisper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to win at
least one game of the set from P. E. for the sake
of our reputation with the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be a heap better players than we are
now before we win anything from him. There&rsquo;s
something about his serving that I can&rsquo;t understand,
some magic that we don&rsquo;t know about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The magic of skill, that&rsquo;s all, Charlie.
Play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ball came back as before. This set told
nearly the same story as the first, Disbrow winning
all the points up to the last game of the set.
The first game had been a <i>love game</i>, meaning
that Disbrow had won all the points. On the
fifth game of the second set, George made a
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
point on his opponent because Disbrow had
missed his footing on the soft ground of the
court.</p>
<p>The girls were delighted. Somehow they did
not like the idea of seeing the Tramp Boys
wholly defeated, though they knew well that the
point would not have been scored for the boys,
had the champion been playing on a hard court.</p>
<p>That was the last and only point won by
George and Charlie in that set. In the last
game of the set, Disbrow, apparently having become
warmed up, threw himself into the work
with utter abandon, this time playing faster than
he had at any time before that. His right arm,
the sleeve rolled nearly to the shoulder, grew
rosy from the rapid exercise, his ordinarily pale
face showed a delicate flush and his eyes sparkled
with excitement, even though his opponents
were not worthy of the name.</p>
<p>From that time on followed the most wonderful
exhibition of tennis playing that any person
present had ever seen. And further, hopping
on one foot was not the only remarkable
thing about Disbrow&rsquo;s playing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hopth jutht like a jack rabbit,&rdquo; cried
Tommy. &ldquo;I believe I could do that, too. Harriet,
that ith the trouble with our playing&mdash;we
don&rsquo;t hop. I&rsquo;ll know what to do the next time
we play tennith. Then I&rsquo;ll thurely win.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will hop on your head if you try it,&rdquo;
warned Sam.</p>
<p>The game came to a close, to the regret of all
except the players opposed to the champion. As
for them, they had had enough of it. They
were not anxious to play another game.</p>
<p>Excitement ran high. The girls wanted to
shout with all their lung power. Tommy did,
giving unrestrained vent to her emotions. The
camp of the Meadow-Brook Girls was vibrant
with enthusiasm. They were eager to be at a
game of their own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can hardly hold myself, I am so eager to
play,&rdquo; declared Harriet, eyes and cheeks glowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, give heed to what I say,&rdquo; requested
Disbrow, with a shake of the head. &ldquo;I will first
teach you the strokes. There are five strokes on
which are built the whole structure of modern
tennis playing, viz., the service stroke, the horizontal
ground stroke, the volley, the half-volley
and the lob. There are, of course, variations of
these, such as the drop-stroke, the side-stroke
and the cut&mdash;or chop&mdash;all of which you will take
up in their regular order, learning one thoroughly,
then going on to the next. Two of you
take your places in the court and practise the
service.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Harriet and Tommy did so, Jane and Hazel
being told to listen and observe closely, as their
turn would follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The service&mdash;that is, putting the ball into
play&mdash;should be an overhand delivery, almost
straight, with a slight cut to the right to keep
the ball from sailing in the air,&rdquo; continued Disbrow.
&ldquo;Reach up high, rising on the left toe,
bringing the ball sharply down into the opponent&rsquo;s
court. Now we shall practise the service
for a time until your wrists grow tired. And
right here let me suggest that when the racquet
is not in action it is a good idea to rest it across
the left hand, which relieves the right wrist wonderfully.
Boys, please get into the other court
and return the balls. We shan&rsquo;t have time to
chase them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet and Tommy made their first service,
but Harriet put so much force into the ball that
it rolled out of the other court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much speed, Miss Burrell. Try that
again. There, that is much better. Now, Miss
Thompson.&rdquo; She, too, did better this time.</p>
<p>Hazel and Jane were next given a chance.
While they were learning the tricks and twists
of the service, Harriet and Tommy were practising
it by themselves just beyond the court,
Disbrow now and then offering a criticism or a
suggestion.</p>
<p>Nearly two hours were spent on the service
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
stroke alone. Then, after a brief rest, they took
up the half-volley, which Disbrow explained was
the art of trapping the ball with the racquet,
blocking it&mdash;not striking it&mdash;just as it rises
from the ground. The girls worked faithfully
all that forenoon, declining to halt for any long
period of rest until their instructor finally insisted
upon it. How much progress they had
made they could only guess, for Mr. Disbrow
did not commit himself. During the luncheon,
of course, the talk was on tennis. The very air
was charged with tennis. The Meadow-Brook
Girls, the Tramp Club, the guardian and the
English champion breathed in the atmosphere
of the game as they did the fragrant air of the
pines that surrounded the clearing where the
court had been laid.</p>
<p>Now that he was not playing, Mr. Disbrow
walked with a more noticeable limp than before.
He denied, however, that his two sets on the
court had had anything to do with this. He said
inactivity, sitting about and doing nothing, was
responsible for the stiffness of the muscles of
the injured ankle.</p>
<p>After luncheon the girls were eager to get at
their practice again, but the instructor said they
must digest their food first. In the meantime he
gave them some detailed instruction regarding
the importance of holding the racquet correctly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One principal reason why you appear to
play so awkwardly is that you do not know how
to hold your racquets,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Before coming
to that I am going to give you three things
to store away in your minds and think of whenever
you are not thinking of anything else.
That&rsquo;s an Irish bull, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Englishman couldn&rsquo;t make one,&rdquo; retorted
Jane quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three things are <i>how</i> to hit the ball,
<i>where</i> to hit the ball and <i>when</i> to hit the ball.
Just think that over, young ladies. To return
to the best way of holding the racquet; remember
that the grasp on it should always allow the
greatest possible freedom for the muscles of the
wrist. Always avoid a cramped position. The
full length of the handle should always be used,
the end of the handle resting against the fleshy
part of the palm. That isn&rsquo;t difficult to remember,
is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each girl replied by adjusting her racquet
to the right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For forehand play the grip of the hand
should be along the handle with the first finger
separated from the others and extended an inch
or two farther along the racquet. The finger
nails when at rest on the handle should face the
direction the ball is to go. In making the backhand
stroke, which you will learn this afternoon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
the fingers should be closer together and the
thumb extended out along the handle behind the
racquet. The second or middle knuckles should
face in the direction the ball is to be driven. I
think that will be enough lecture for the present.
Do you all thoroughly understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we do,&rdquo; answered Harriet. &ldquo;I
would suggest that we go through the forehand
and backhand strokes to make certain that we
are right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disbrow nodded his approval. Most of the
girls hit it the first time, all on the second trial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we will practise the various strokes,
first going over what we learned this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The practice for the rest of the day was real
work. There was no inspiration in it, though
the Meadow-Brook spirit was strong upon the
four girls, and not for a moment did they permit
themselves to feel the monotony that the
Tramp Boys long since had found. The girls
devoted themselves painstakingly to every
stroke taught them. The new instruction meant
the undoing of much that they had already
learned, but that was to be expected. The girls
were not to be disturbed by it.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon they asked permission
to play a game, but the Englishman declined to
allow it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may not play a game even to-morrow,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
he added. &ldquo;It will depend upon the progress
you make for the rest of the day and to-morrow
forenoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was so patient and gentle with them that
the girls, knowing what a trial they must be,
found themselves greatly drawn to their instructor.</p>
<p>There seemed to be little difference in the progress
of the girls, except in the case of Tommy.
Her companions were amazed at her work.
One would not have thought it of Tommy
Thompson. She was as pleased over her success
and as enthusiastic as any of her companions.
Added to this was a full measure of the
Meadow-Brook &ldquo;do or die&rdquo; spirit that always
had characterized this little organization
of wide-awake girls.</p>
<p>After supper they all sat and talked around
the campfire, before which the Englishman comfortably
stretched himself, after having asked
permission to do so. Later on in the evening
the boys escorted him to his tent. On the morrow
they were to move him over to their own
camp, his ankle now being strong enough to enable
him to walk about with some degree of
comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think about them?&rdquo; was
Captain George&rsquo;s eager question when they had
entered the Englishman&rsquo;s tent that night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A fine lot of young women,&rdquo; answered Disbrow
enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all about that. But what about this
tournament&mdash;what are the prospects, do you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty early to answer that question, isn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have come to some conclusion about it,
I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Burrell has the making of a great tennis
player,&rdquo; answered the champion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I said,&rdquo; cried George enthusiastically.
&ldquo;I knew I&rsquo;d picked a winner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a wise little head on her shoulders,
George. She uses it, too. It is working all the
time, which is a most necessary quality in a tennis
player. I know of no sport that requires
more of this quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think the girls have a chance to
win out in the tournament! I can&rsquo;t tell you how
glad I am to have you say that. It repays me
for a lot of stewing, old man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, old chappie. I haven&rsquo;t said that
at all. On the contrary, I do not consider that
they have the slightest chance of winning in the
doubles at your tournament if, as you say, there
are several clever teams entered. How could
you expect it? They may stay in for a few sets
just because of that wonderful pluck and spirit.
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
But the finals&rdquo;&mdash;the Englishman shook his
head. &ldquo;Hopeless, George. You might as well
make up your mind to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Baker groaned dismally. Then he
gripped his friend&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t tell them that, P. E.? Please
don&rsquo;t tell them that. It would so discourage
them that they would quit instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know your friends, I see,&rdquo; answered
Disbrow with a short laugh. &ldquo;They
would laugh at me were I to make such an announcement,
and tell me very quietly and confidently
that they were going to enter the tournament
and were going to win. What are you going
to do with such spirit as that? I take off
my hat to it. Whatever P. Earlington Disbrow
can do for those plucky young women he is going
to do, and don&rsquo;t forget it, Captain George
Baker!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br /><span class="small">A STEAM ROLLER TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>
<p>The tired girls were awakened by a terrific
racket. Groanings, clankings and an
unfamiliar hiss greeted their ears. They
opened their eyes to find that the day had
dawned. But what meant this terrible uproar?
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
A shrill, piercing whistle split the calm of the
morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thave me! A train of carth ith coming
through the woodth,&rdquo; cried Tommy. &ldquo;Oh, thtop
them! They&rsquo;ll run over the tennith court.
Thave me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet, who had sprung out of bed ahead of
her companions, ran to the tent-opening and
peered out. Her eyes grew large as she gazed.
What she saw was a huge steam roller, enveloped
in a cloud of steam. The roller was bumping
over the uneven ground, jerking from side to
side and making frantic efforts to escape from
the rough trail over which the guiding hand of
the engineer was directing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For mercy&rsquo;s sake, what does it mean?&rdquo;
gasped Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It evidently is a mistake,&rdquo; replied Miss Elting.
&ldquo;He has missed his way. Isn&rsquo;t that man
from Meadow-Brook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is. But I do not know him. I have
seen him driving his steam roller through the
streets. He is employed on the improved roads,
I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming right this way. He will run
down the tent,&rdquo; cried Margery.</p>
<p>The engineer made a detour at this stage,
skirting the tennis court, then once more heading
down toward the tent. He continued on his
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
uneven way until right opposite the Meadow-Brook
tent and but a few yards distant from it,
when he shut off and stopped. Instantly a great
burst of escaping steam roared from the safety
valve, enveloping the roller in such a cloud that
for the moment it was entirely obscured. The
furnace door opened with a clank. When a
gentle breeze blew the steam across the court
toward the woods the girls saw the engineer
lighting his pipe. This accomplished, he grasped
the whistle lever, pulled the valve wide open
and held it there, filling the air with an ear-splitting
noise that lasted for a full minute and was
deafening to say the least.</p>
<p>The girls were peering out through the narrow
slit at the opening of their tent, but immediately
on the starting of the whistle they poked
their fingers in their ears to shut out the awful
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; yelled Crazy Jane. But the whistle
drowned the sound of her voice, the latter
being barely heard by her companions in the
tent.</p>
<p>About this time they discovered P. Earlington
Disbrow hopping from his tent with the aid of
his stick. He had hastily drawn on his clothes,
his hair was standing up in an unkempt shock.
He approached the steam roller in a series of
leaps and bounds, aided by his stick. The engineer,
observing him, finally decided to let go of
the whistle lever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you bally driver, what do you mean
by waking civilized people up by that din?&rdquo; he
demanded angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the place?&rdquo; questioned the engineer
innocently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is the place, but blowing all the steam
out of your boiler wasn&rsquo;t a part of the job for
which you were engaged. Either stop that
racket or pull off where we won&rsquo;t hear you. It&rsquo;s
five o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got to get through and go back on a road
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be finished before you start if you
don&rsquo;t watch out. Pull away from there. There
are ladies in that tent. I don&rsquo;t flatter myself
that they are asleep. If this were a cemetery
nobody would be asleep now, after your salutation
to the dawn. Pull out, I tell you, and give
them a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer jerked the throttle open and
started his lumbering craft ahead without a
word of reply to the irate Englishman, who was
regarding him with frowning eyes. The engineer
drove his engine to the edge of the clearing,
where once more the steam began to blow
off, but he mercifully refrained from pulling the
whistle. After the roller had come to a halt
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
again, Disbrow hopped back to his own tent,
where he took his time about making his morning
toilet.</p>
<p>In the meantime the girls were gazing at each
other wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; questioned the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; replied Harriet. &ldquo;You
heard Mr. Disbrow admit that the man had
made no mistake in coming here. But what
need have we for a steam roller unless it be to
run over us, which perhaps might be a good
thing after all,&rdquo; she added with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dress yourselves, girls,&rdquo; ordered Miss Elting.
&ldquo;We have overslept as it is. Perhaps it
is just as well that the steam roller woke us
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I prefer another kind of alarm
clock,&rdquo; chuckled Harriet. &ldquo;This one is too violent
and nerve-racking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Disbrow was out a second time before the
girls had made ready for their first appearance.
He walked over and held a brief conversation
with the driver of the roller, after which he sat
down by his own tent to await the coming of the
girls, who, he felt sure, would soon be out.</p>
<p>They were. They shouted a cheery good morning
to their guest, who thereupon hobbled over
to them, looking somewhat embarrassed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To whom are we indebted for the steam
roller?&rdquo; asked the guardian lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owe you an apology, ladies. When I sent
word to the man to come here, I did not for a
moment imagine he would find it advisable to
drive his hideous vehicle into camp before breakfast.
I have expressed as much to him, though
in somewhat less temperate language,&rdquo; added
Disbrow with a faint smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The apology is accepted, sir,&rdquo; answered
Harriet gravely. &ldquo;But we are still in the dark
as to the reason for this&mdash;this visitation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes. I took it upon myself. You see, I
need some practice, my late accident making it
necessary that I, too, begin playing. No better
opportunity will present itself. However, the
court being in such wretched shape I dare not
attempt any work upon it. It was for that
reason that I had the boys send to town for a
steam roller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To pack down the court! Oh, that is it,&rdquo;
said Harriet brightly. &ldquo;How can we thank
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No necessity, Miss Burrell. I tell you it was
principally in my own behalf that I ordered the
roller. I didn&rsquo;t order the whistle. That is
thrown in gratis. When the boys get here we
will have the net taken down so that the man
can begin his work of rolling the court.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No need to wait for the boys. Come on,
girls,&rdquo; cried Harriet.</p>
<p>They ran to the court and, pulling up the
stakes, laid the net flat, after which they rolled it
carefully. The net was then removed and laid
beside their tent, racquets and stakes were gathered
up and stowed in the same place. It was all
done with the usual snap of the Meadow-Brook
Girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You American girls certainly have the initiative,&rdquo;
declared Disbrow approvingly. &ldquo;You
aren&rsquo;t afraid to do things. Now, if you were
English, you would sit about and look languid,
you would wait until the men came to do the
work for you. Not so the American girl. When
there is a thing to be done she does it. That is
all there is to it. I&rsquo;ll tell that driver to start in.
I believe he has gone to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thhall I throw a thtone at him?&rdquo; questioned
Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; answered the guardian severely.
&ldquo;Run over and tell him we are ready
for him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! Leave that for me,&rdquo; protested Disbrow.
But Harriet was already running toward
the roller. She awakened the driver, telling
him he might begin work at once. He delayed
a long time before starting, first feeding
more coal into the fire box and oiling the rheumatic
joints of the machine before starting.
While Mr. Disbrow was showing the driver how
the court was to be rolled, the girls were hurriedly
preparing breakfast. Had they not been enthusiastic
before, they surely would be now that
their instructor had gone to all this pains and
expense in their behalf. They well knew that it
was done wholly on their own account, despite
his explanations to the contrary.</p>
<p>Captain George and his party arrived after
the girls had finished their breakfast and the
man was still clanking back and forth over the
court, which was being slowly packed down into
a firm surface that shone under the polish put
on by the heavy roller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are up early this morning,&rdquo; remarked
Disbrow, &ldquo;but we have finished our breakfast.
You will have to wait until luncheon time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had our breakfast, thank you,&rdquo; answered
Sam. &ldquo;What time did the automobile get
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That got here before breakfatht, too,&rdquo; answered
Tommy. &ldquo;You mutht have thlept pretty
thoundly not to have heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did hear it. We heard the whistle,&rdquo; replied
George. &ldquo;Fine time of day to get here.
Who cleared the court?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young ladies,&rdquo; answered Disbrow, with
a reproving glance at the Tramp Boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad we all had sprained ankles,&rdquo; retorted
Sam mischievously, whereat a smile
flitted over the pale face of P. Earlington Disbrow.</p>
<p>By eight o&rsquo;clock Disbrow, after walking over
the court and poking it with his stick, pronounced
it satisfactory. He paid the driver of
the outfit and dismissed him. The boys were directed
to place the net, while the instructor
looked on critically. When it came to measuring
the court, he insisted on doing this himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of vital importance that one practise
under the identical conditions that will prevail
in the match game. George, set up stakes and
stretch a string so that all our lines may be
true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the court was completed, about an hour
later, the campers gazed upon it delightedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is a real court!&rdquo; cried Harriet with
glowing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And now you shall do some real playing.
We shall have our strokes first, then we
shall see you put them into practice in a real
game. I&rsquo;ll be playing myself if I look at that
handsome court any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day&rsquo;s work was welcomed with enthusiasm
by the Meadow-Brook team. Three sets
were played before luncheon time, and rather
spirited games they were. The girls with each
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
succeeding game grew more and more proficient
as the different strokes became more mechanical
to them, and when a halt was called for the
noon meal P. Earlington Disbrow showed real
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine, fine!&rdquo; he exclaimed, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think we thall win the tournament?&rdquo;
questioned Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Thompson, we are not cup-winners
yet; we are still in the novice class.
We hope to advance a step a day until we get
into one of the higher classes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long rest was taken after luncheon, and then
the afternoon was a repetition of the morning
with work made easy by the enthusiasm and the
painstaking effort of the Meadow-Brook Girls.
It had been the first really successful day since
they began their practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One point in your favor,&rdquo; declared Disbrow
as he was leaving the Meadow-Brook camp that
night, &ldquo;is your wonderful endurance. I believe
in a long race you would wear out a steam engine.
Add skill to that quality of endurance and
you will be heard from one of these days on the
tennis court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this cheering word still ringing in their
ears the Meadow-Brook Girls tumbled into bed
and went to sleep almost as soon as they had
drawn their blankets under their chins.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br /><span class="small">WOULD-BE CUP WINNERS BREAK CAMP</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, P. E., what do you think now?&rdquo;
asked Captain Baker on the first
opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, as I did when you asked me that
question some time ago, that the Meadow-Brook
team will attract considerable attention by their
playing in the Coast Tournament. They may
even get a place well up in the list, but so far as
winning any of the prizes, I do not believe they
are far enough advanced for that. Their progress,
during the four weeks we have been at
work, is nothing less than marvelous. Sometimes
I almost believe they will be fit for a championship
match. Then I discover that I&rsquo;ve been
carried away by that confounded Meadow-Brook
enthusiasm. It&rsquo;s as catching as the
plague, old chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re all obliged to you for what
you&rsquo;ve done, P. E.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, it isn&rsquo;t Earlington Disbrow who
has done it; it is the young women themselves.
You can&rsquo;t make tennis players out of unavailable
material. About all I have done, besides
giving them some technical points, has been to
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
keep them at work. They would have done that
just the same had I been on the other side of the
ocean. At times they show excellent form; then
again they fall off without any reason that I am
able to discover. In two or three years from
now we&rsquo;ll hear from the Meadow-Brook Girls,
but I should say it would take all that time
to make champions of them, in spite of their
unshaken determination to win out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you going to pair them off when we
get to the tournament?&rdquo; The Englishman had
announced his intention of witnessing all the
matches at Newtown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I have not fully decided. I may do it
in a way that you won&rsquo;t approve,&rdquo; smiled Disbrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the doctor, we are the patients,&rdquo;
nodded George. &ldquo;Well, at any rate, it has been
worth the price of admission to have you up here
with us, and I shall never forget what you&rsquo;ve
done for us, and for me especially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chop it, old chap! You jolly well know the
shoe is on the other foot. Besides, I&rsquo;ve had
some much needed practice on my own account.
I am fit as a fiddle now, ready to take on any
matches that may be arranged for me. This has
been a great vacation for me.&rdquo; The speaker
expanded his chest, inhaling deeply of the air
that was heavy with the odor of the pines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Were I to remain up here all summer I
think I might gain something of the endurance
that those young women possess. It&rsquo;s wonderful,
as I have said before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four weeks had elapsed since the arrival of
P. Earlington Disbrow. During that time real
work had been done in the camp of the Meadow-Brook
Girls. They had practised early and late,
and when not actually at practice were listening
to words of wisdom, born of the experience
of a world champion. Now they possessed a
theoretical knowledge of the game that was
barely second to that of Disbrow himself. They
had learned to serve drop curves, over-head
curves, to place the tennis ball almost with the
accuracy of rifle fire; they had with varying degrees
of success become able to accomplish the
difficult <i>twist service</i>, so puzzling to the novice,
much as would be the well-known curves of the
baseball player to one who did not understand
them; their foot work had improved, they had
been taught to conserve their energies, to leap
from the toes in springing to meet a ball&mdash;in
fact, had been coached in all the little delicate
arts of the game that had already made their
instructor famous wherever tennis was played.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>And now the period of their work in camp
had come to an end. Only five days remained
before the opening of the tournament at Newtown,
where they would either win recognition
or suffer humiliating defeat. Harriet still persisted
in her belief in herself and her companions.
Disbrow did not seek to shake that confidence,
being well aware that without it they
had better remain out of the contest entirely.</p>
<p>It had been planned that he was to meet them
at Newtown three days hence. He wished them
to play a set over each of the courts, but they
were not to do anything like the hard work they
had been doing on the court in the pine woods,
nor were they to touch a racquet during the
days between then and the time they reported at
Newtown. This had been the champion&rsquo;s strictest
injunction to them.</p>
<p>The girls were to go home to arrange their
clothing. After no little discussion it had been
decided that they were to wear their regular
Camp Girl uniforms, minus the beads. These
costumes, being especially arranged for freedom
of muscular play and comfort, were ideal for
the purpose, except that they were of blue serge,
while all the other players would be dressed in
white. This would mean that the figures of the
Meadow-Brook Girls would stand out from all
the rest, which might prove a disadvantage when
standing before the nets. Harriet understood
this well, but she had been determined on the
Camp Girl uniform for reasons of her own,
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
which she did not confide to her companions nor
to the Tramp Boys.</p>
<p>Jane had been to town and brought her automobile.
The camp had been struck by the boys
and packed ready for the wagon that was coming
from town to take them home. The girls
and Mr. Disbrow were to return in Jane&rsquo;s car,
he to go on to Boston that evening. They were
holding their last meeting in the old camping
place, which, now that they were about to leave,
seemed dearer than ever to them. None of that
little party would ever forget the weeks spent
in that clearing in the pine woods. The summer
vacation that had opened so tamely bade
fair to close in a giddy whirl of excitement. It
had already been full to overflowing with activity
and accomplishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, you are to follow out my directions
regarding the care of yourselves between
now and the time I see you again, young ladies,&rdquo;
reminded Mr. Disbrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be on hand early and look over the
practice of the other contestants. I may be able
to offer you some suggestions as to what to do
or what not to do after I have seen some of the
other contestants in action. As for my share in
your training, it will be well for you to forget
that. From now on you are to be placed upon
your own responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are asking an impossibility,&rdquo; replied
Harriet. &ldquo;Whatever may follow, we owe you
a debt of gratitude that nothing can ever repay,
both you and the boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go in and win. That will be payment
enough,&rdquo; answered Mr. Disbrow with a light
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what we are going to do,&rdquo; replied
Harriet earnestly.</p>
<p>He did not contradict her. He knew in his
own mind that the Meadow-Brook team could
not carry off the cup. The most that could be
hoped for was one of the smaller prizes. If
they stood up under the grilling of the first few
games, they would have done remarkably well.
He should call that achievement worth while,
let alone winning the cup.</p>
<p>About the middle of the forenoon the wagon
came up from town and the boys began loading
the equipment, after which they were to take up
their own camp. The tennis racquets the girls
had kept with them. They had chosen their racquets
after trying out all weights, Harriet finally
choosing a fourteen-ounce racquet, an unusually
heavy weight for a woman player. Mr. Disbrow
had advised against this heavy weight, but
after observing her work with this and then
with a lighter one approved her choice. Harriet,
though slight, was very strong, and under
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
the practice on the court her wrists had become
as pliant as steel.</p>
<p>They placed their smaller belongings in the
car and got in, then, with shouts of good-bye to
the boys and to the camp, turned their faces
homeward.</p>
<p>The news had traveled abroad in Meadow-Brook
that the Meadow-Brook Girls were to
take part in the Coast Tournament, which entry
caused no little interest. It had not been known
that the girls played tennis at all. Some little
argument had been necessary to gain the permission
of the girls&rsquo; parents, but Miss Elting
had taken the matter in hand, and in the end
won their consent. Not only this, but the parents
were arranging to go to Newtown to see
the tournament.</p>
<p>The plans of the party embraced some unusual
features. They were to make camp and
live in tents, cooking their own food, living their
regular outdoor life just the same as if they
were encamped in the woods. Mr. Disbrow approved
of this. Any change in their method of
living might affect them adversely, and the girls
were thankful for his approval.</p>
<p>That afternoon, after the girls had taken their
instructor to each of their homes and introduced
him to their parents, Disbrow boarded a train
for Boston. He had skilfully evaded the direct
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
questions of the parents as to what chances the
girls had to win. Tommy&rsquo;s father was delighted
at the opportunity presented to her. Whether
or not she won anything, it would be of great
benefit to his little daughter, who, from a delicate
girl, had developed into a muscular young
woman.</p>
<p>True to their promise, the girls did no practising,
though in her room at home, using the
wall to receive the ball under her light touches,
Harriet studied out problems of service. It was
not practice, according to her reasoning; it was
study. But most of her time was occupied in
sewing and in performing her regular duties
about the house, which she persisted in doing
despite her mother&rsquo;s protestations.</p>
<p>In the meantime the Tramp Boys had moved,
bag and baggage, to Newtown. They not only
had taken their own equipment, but that of the
Meadow-Brook Girls as well. George, after
consultation with Mr. Herrington, would decide
on a site for the camp, which, owing to his acquaintance
with the manager of the tournament,
would be almost any site the captain chose.
George was very fortunate in his friends, and
he never hesitated to use them, being fully as
ready and willing to be used himself whenever
he could be of service. Then, again, in the present
instance he felt a proprietary interest beyond
the ordinary one of friendship. It was his
team, as he chose to call it. He had made the
entry, he would be responsible for the Meadow-Brook
Girls&rsquo; appearance on the courts in the
tournament. He had no great hopes now of
their winning the cup, but he did believe the
Meadow-Brook pluck and endurance would land
them in a position some little distance from the
tail-end of the procession of defeated contestants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>On the third morning the girls were up early,
for they were to make an early start for Newtown,
nearly three hours&rsquo; drive by motor car
from their home town. As usual, they were to
be accompanied by Miss Elting. No other persons
accompanied them. The parents were not
to go on until the day the tournament was to
open. Their personal belongings and their precious
racquets were stowed in the car and in the
luggage trunk that was strapped on behind. It
was a new car that Jane&rsquo;s father had purchased
for her to take the place of the one lost in the
ice pond on that fateful night the year previous,
when Harriet had narrowly escaped drowning.</p>
<p>Their departure was a quiet one. The car
simply called at the homes of the girls and
picked them up as if they were just going out for
a pleasure drive. Tommy was the only nervous
one in the party. Jane was full of merry chatter,
Buster grumbling, as usual, and Harriet
silent and thoughtful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re off for the killing,&rdquo; announced
Jane, after having picked up the last of her passengers
and started on her way. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s
not saying who it is that&rsquo;s going to be killed,&rdquo;
she added with a chuckle.</p>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br /><span class="small">IN CAMP ON THE BATTLE FIELD</span></h2>
<p>Newtown, as already mentioned, was a
summer resort. There were many
fine summer homes, excellent bathing,
a limited number of hotels, and a large population
of fashionable summer visitors.</p>
<p>This year the tournament had excited more
than ordinary interest because arranged wholly
for women. Not a man was to take part in any
event, though most of the teams were managed
by relatives or family friends. That it was to
be a bitter fight was evident from the activity
of the preparations and the care with which the
various minor officials had been chosen. A very
large attendance was promised and it was believed
that some future champions would be developed
from the contest. This, as a matter of
fact, was the fond hope of Jack Herrington, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
manager, who had arranged this unusual tournament.
One team from which much was expected
was a club of girls from the summer colony,
fashionable young women who had spent
some years playing tennis.</p>
<p>This latter club consisted of four girls, just as
did the Meadow-Brook entry. One pair was entered
as &ldquo;The Fifth Avenues,&rdquo; the other as
&ldquo;The Riversides.&rdquo; All their practising had
been done on the private court belonging to one
of the girls, so that no one outside of the few on
the inside really knew what they were doing.
Then there were other clubs from various parts
of the State. One team from Portsmouth, the
Scott Sisters, were known to be among the most
expert tennis players in the ranks of the younger
players, and among those who claimed to know,
it was believed that the Scott Sisters were sure
winners, provided the Fifth Avenues and the
Riversides did not carry off the cup. There was
just enough mystery in the entries of the latter
to cause a great deal of speculation and arouse
keen interest.</p>
<p>Jane McCarthy and her passengers arrived in
Newtown at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon of
the day on which they had left home. Their arrival
attracted no attention, for the girls were
unknown to the residents of Newtown. Jane
did not know where to go. Harriet called a halt
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
and soon learned where the office of the manager
was. They repaired there at once, only to
find that he was out on the tennis field. They
were directed how to get there and drove away
in search of it.</p>
<p>The tennis field was located on the outskirts
of the town in an open field. The nets were not
yet in place, but men were working on the
courts, packing these down with hand rollers in
some instances, in others chalking out the lines,
taking measurements, working on the covered
stand where seats were held at high prices for
such spectators as wished to be under cover and
out of the direct rays of the sun. The girls were
directed to the manager. They waited while
Harriet went over to speak to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are one of the Meadow-Brook Girls,
eh?&rdquo; he exclaimed, extending a cordial hand.
&ldquo;George Baker has told me all about you. You
look as though you could give a good account of
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Miss McCarthy&rsquo;s car yonder. We drove
over from Meadow-Brook this morning. Do
you know whether Mr. Baker has made our camp
or not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has,&rdquo; answered Herrington, regarding
the brown-faced young woman keenly, pleased
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
both with her manner and her apparently splendid
condition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you kindly direct me to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, Miss Burrell. The camp is
pitched just within the edge of those trees at the
far side of the field yonder,&rdquo; pointing to a
grove. &ldquo;You are the only contestants who, so
far as I am aware, are camping out. Baker tells
me that you prefer it. I consider it an excellent
idea, provided the weather is good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we do not mind bad weather. We are
quite well used to all kinds,&rdquo; answered Harriet,
her face lighting up in a happy smile. &ldquo;Are
any of the other players here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of those from out of town so far as I
know. Some of them may be staying with
friends. None has reported to me. I should
like to meet your companions if you have no objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be glad to know you,&rdquo; answered
Harriet, turning back toward the car, with Mr.
Herrington walking beside her. The manager
was presented to Miss Elting and each of the
Meadow-Brook Girls in turn. He said he knew
Grace Thompson&rsquo;s father quite well and that
he also knew Mr. McCarthy by reputation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I was the only member of our family
who had a reputation,&rdquo; blurted out Jane.
&ldquo;Between myself and the motor car pretty
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
nearly every one in our part of the State has
met disaster. Is that our camp over yonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Herrington, with an amused
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I drive the car over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may. But please go around the outside
edge of the field so as not to cut up the turf
near the courts. We have spent some weeks on
these grounds, and are naturally very careful
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very beautiful field,&rdquo; remarked the
guardian admiringly. &ldquo;I see there are no nets
up. When will you stretch them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any time you may wish after to-day. I suppose
you have reference to practice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All shall have opportunity to accustom
themselves to the various courts, for until the
drawings I cannot say what teams will play on
certain courts. The singles are to be played off
first. We are reserving the doubles until the
last because there is greater interest in these,
and by holding them until the last we shall hold
the attendance as well. You see there is a business
side to this tournament, a side that is not
wholly unselfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; agreed Miss Elting. &ldquo;Have you
many entries?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the doubles? Yes, there are twenty entries.
I imagine there will not be quite so many
as that on the second day of the double events,&rdquo;
added Mr. Herrington. &ldquo;George Baker has
been scouting for news; he is a regular sleuth.
He will tell you all about it. You will find him
at the camp; his own camp is farther back in
the woods. And, by the way, I have given him
permission to pitch a dressing tent just beyond
the last court on that side. He will not do that
until just before the doubles are called. Any of
the other players who desire it may have the
same privilege. I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it until
Baker suggested the idea, which is a good one.
Next year we shall do this ourselves. I hope
you may be with us then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite likely that we shall,&rdquo; answered
Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are quite confident of the result
this year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to do our best,&rdquo; replied Harriet
Burrell modestly. &ldquo;We are new at the
game. Five weeks ago we practically knew
nothing of the game. What we have done has
been done within that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you luck, my dear young ladies, but
you will find yourselves in pretty hot company
for girls of your limited experience at the nets.
Most of the contestants have been playing for
years at home, though very few of them, I believe,
have ever participated in a public match.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear it,&rdquo; said the Meadow-Brook
Girl with a smile. This was good news
to Harriet Burrell and she stowed it away in
her mind for future consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Baker tells me that Earlington Disbrow
is a friend of yours and that he is coming down
here from Boston to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Disbrow has been good enough to
take an interest in our work,&rdquo; answered Miss
Elting innocently. &ldquo;We shall be glad to see an
old acquaintance again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Herrington bowed low, expressing his
pleasure at having met so renowned a party as
the Meadow-Brooks, and, requesting that they
call upon him for anything in his power to grant,
returned to his supervision of the courts.</p>
<p>As they neared the edge of the wood the tents
began to stand out more plainly. These were
just within the edge of the grove. Out in the
field a short distance from the edge of the grove
they saw a number of khaki-clad boys at work.
So busy were the latter that up to this time they
had failed to observe the approach of the motor
car.</p>
<p>Jane blew her horn. The boys heard and recognized
the sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Meadow-Brooks!&rdquo; shouted George
Baker. &ldquo;Give &rsquo;em a cheer, fellows. Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>The boys tossed their hats in the air and
whooped so loudly that the men at work on the
courts at the opposite end of the field paused in
their work to look and listen. The Meadow-Brook
Girls answered with their club yell, the
car came to a stop in front of the boys and the
girls hopped out. Hand-shaking was the order
of the day for the next few minutes, during
which the girls were overwhelmed with questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fit as fiddles all around,&rdquo; declared George
after a critical look into the smiling face of
each girl. &ldquo;Miss Brown is the only soft one in
the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not soft,&rdquo; flung back Margery indignantly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have you know that. You ought
to know it without my telling you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get angry over it, Miss Margery,&rdquo; answered
George laughingly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to
hurt your feelings. What I meant was that you
were not in the pink of condition like the other
girls. They have been in training for some
weeks, you know, so you could not be expected
to come up to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Buster, somewhat mollified, smiled and sat
down. The girls glanced about them inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you boys doing here?&rdquo; demanded
the guardian, glancing curiously about her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Elting, they are making a practice
court,&rdquo; cried Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, boys, you shouldn&rsquo;t have gone to all
that trouble. The games come on the day
after to-morrow and we shall have very little
use for a court. Then, again, you have peeled off
the sod. Why couldn&rsquo;t we have practised on a
grass court for the short time?&rdquo; asked the guardian.
&ldquo;Of course we appreciate this, just as we
do everything you have done for us, but you
have done altogether too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; replied George, &ldquo;all you
will wish to do on the courts out there is to warm
up, to limber up. You will wish to practise some
of your fancy strokes, which you can do here
without any one observing you. We shall see to
that. We shall stand guard and not let any one
near the court while you girls are at work. The
reason we peeled the sod is that you will play on
a hard court in the contest. To play on a grass
court here for practice might undo all you have
accomplished thus far with regard to foot work.
I know P. E. would agree with me in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hathn&rsquo;t George got a head to be proud of?&rdquo;
demanded Tommy. &ldquo;I withh I had a head like
hith, only much more beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Captain George bowed with
great ceremony, as though deeply appreciative
of this rather doubtful compliment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You do think of everything, George,&rdquo; remarked
Harriet. &ldquo;You are right, too. This
court will be of no little assistance to us for the
finishing touches. I have some new strokes that
I have thought out, strokes that I should like to
try without any one&rsquo;s observing me. Come, let&rsquo;s
look at the tents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were two of these, one for Miss Elting,
the other for the girls. The boys had given the
guardian one of their small camping tents. The
girls uttered exclamations of surprise when they
entered the tent. Everything was arranged with
as much taste as they themselves could have
shown. In addition to this the interiors of the
two tents were decorated with cedar boughs that
the lads had gathered by the wayside on their
way to Newtown. On the two end poles crossed
tennis racquets had been fastened with a tennis
ball in the crotch formed by each pair of racquets.
In the center of the girls&rsquo; tent was a
small folding table covered with a scarf that
George had borrowed from his mother, and on
the center of the table stood a pitcher filled with
roses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you boys, you boys!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Elting, her eyes shining happily. In her own
tent she found a similar condition.</p>
<p>The girls looked their deep appreciation
rather than expressing it in mere words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to put up a dressing tent for you
before the games,&rdquo; said George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Herrington told us,&rdquo; answered
Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you&rsquo;ve met Jack? There won&rsquo;t be
much in the tent but a few blankets and a cot.
You will appreciate that tent when you have a
rest between sets. We shall have water there
for bathing your faces to help you cool off. I
think we are in for some roasting weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody would think this was a prize fight
that was about to be fought,&rdquo; declared Sam abruptly.
George fixed him with a rebuking
glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a great deal is expected of us,&rdquo; replied
Harriet seriously. &ldquo;If we do not do our best,
we are unworthy of such friendship. But,
George, you know what I promised you before
we even began to practise&mdash;that we are going to
win. I repeat that statement now, and I mean
every word of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the talk,&rdquo; said George, but inwardly
he groaned. He knew in his own mind that it
was beyond the power of Harriet and her fellow-players
to carry off the cup. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
want to practise to-day, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps late in the afternoon,&rdquo; answered
Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you what let&rsquo;s do,&rdquo; suggested
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Dill enthusiastically. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s all go down to the
beach for a swim in the surf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! Come on, darlin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; cried Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeth, let&rsquo;th go,&rdquo; urged Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think it would be wise,&rdquo; answered
Harriet reflectively. &ldquo;I should dearly love a
swim, but I do not think it prudent. We might
catch a little cold or stiffen our muscles or something
of the sort. We have too much at stake
to take any chances. I for one shall not go in
the surf and I hope none of you girls will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harriet is right,&rdquo; answered George approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is,&rdquo; agreed Miss Elting. &ldquo;But you
haven&rsquo;t told us the news. Mr. Herrington said
you knew a lot about what had been going on
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George&rsquo;s face took on a more serious expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve turned up a few facts,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is all settled as to who is going
to win the championship cup?&rdquo; said Harriet
with a smile.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they say. They say that the
championship lies between the Scott Sisters and
the two pairs known as the Fifth Avenues and
the Riversides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen them play?&rdquo; asked Harriet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I got hold of a fellow I know who
has seen them play a number of times. He says
they are wonders, regular Indians with the racquets.
I&rsquo;ve got Charlie Mabie scouting now.
He will bring back the news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will not do anything that isn&rsquo;t
quite right, George,&rdquo; said Miss Elting deprecatingly.</p>
<p>The captain shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You&rsquo;ll find they will be doing the same
thing here, or trying to. They will get a hard
bump if they do,&rdquo; he added under his breath.
&ldquo;But you do want to look alive for those
Scott Sisters. From all I can learn, they are
regular professionals, and those who have seen
them play in other matches say they are mighty
tricky players.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean dishonest?&rdquo; questioned Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you might call it that. I mean they
would be if they could get away with it. But
even so, a player sometimes can turn a trick
that isn&rsquo;t fair and not be caught at it, or else is
able to convince the umpire that she didn&rsquo;t do
anything unfair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing of the sort will be done by this
team,&rdquo; declared Harriet Burrell firmly. &ldquo;But
though we shall play fairly, we shall go in prepared
to fight to the bitter end, to fight every
inch of the way until either we drive our
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
opponents off the court or are driven off
of it ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! That&rsquo;s certainly the real hero
talk,&rdquo; shouted Sam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you please keep still,&rdquo; admonished
George. &ldquo;I was about to say that I haven&rsquo;t
learned anything of interest about the other
teams entered for the doubles. In fact, not
much of anything is known here. All of them
will be here to-morrow. Perhaps Herrington
told you that the singles are to be played off
first. Some of the girls in those are to play in
the doubles also. You ought to be able to get
pointers by watching them play in the singles,
learning their tricks and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be helpful,&rdquo; agreed Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you wish to do now, sit down and
rest?&rdquo; questioned the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go back to town and get our food
supplies,&rdquo; answered the guardian. &ldquo;Will you
come with us, George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you. I was going to propose that
you go over to town with me. There&rsquo;s something
there that I want to show you. Oh, you&rsquo;ll
be delighted when you see it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br /><span class="small">THE CUP THAT LURED</span></h2>
<p>The girls lost no time in getting into
Jane&rsquo;s car, accompanied by Captain
Baker, who sat on the front seat with
the driver. They drove slowly around the edge
of the field, thence out into the street, observed
by Jack Herrington with a quizzical smile on his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is as fine a set of girls as I ever
saw,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
if they were heard from at the nets one of these
days. But five weeks&rsquo; practice and entering the
hottest amateur tournament we&rsquo;ve ever had on
the coast!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I ought to ask them
to withdraw their entry, but I couldn&rsquo;t do it
when that Miss Burrell looked at me with
that unflinching, searching gaze of hers.&rdquo; He
laughed as he saw Jane and her car enveloped in
a cloud of dust. Then the Meadow-Brook car
disappeared around the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one certainly can drive a car, even if
she can&rsquo;t play tennis,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>In the meantime the automobile was speeding
through the town, scattering pedestrians right
and left, Jane unheeding the guardian&rsquo;s urgent
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
demands that she drive more slowly. Jane was
in a hurry to learn what it was that Captain
George Baker had in store for them. They were
eager to know about this latest surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are not getting us into more
trouble, Captain,&rdquo; Miss Elting called to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It spells trouble for some one,&rdquo; answered
the captain. &ldquo;No, this is no other game I am
trying to play on you. You have game enough
on hand as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say we have,&rdquo; answered the guardian,
her face taking on a thoughtful expression,
little lines of perplexity forming on her
forehead. &ldquo;Indeed we have, and to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George directed Jane into the main business
street of the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to get your supplies first?&rdquo;
asked the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried the girls with one accord, &ldquo;we
want the surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have it. Pull up before that red
brick building you see on the left there, Miss
Jane. We will get out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They got down hurriedly. They could not imagine
what this new surprise might be. George
led them to the sidewalk, passers-by glancing inquiringly
at the brown-faced girls as well as at
their distinctive blue uniforms, which a few persons
recognized as belonging to the Meadow-Brook
Girls&rsquo; organization. The captain stepped
across the walk to the window of a jewelry store,
where he halted and pointed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is the surprise,&rdquo; he said, his eyes
sparkling, his face flushed.</p>
<p>At first the girls&rsquo; eyes wandered over the
glittering array of costly articles displayed in
the window, their glances finally coming to rest
on a centerpiece that stood out and above all
the rest. That something was a massive silver
cup, standing fully eighteen inches high. The
cup stood by itself, on a black velvet mat.
There was a massive silver handle on either
side. Then they saw that it was a trophy. A
tennis net worked out in silver decorated the
lower part of the cup; above the net were two
crossed racquets and a ball, all in solid silver.</p>
<p>Still further up on the swell, cut deeply into
the polished surface were the words, &ldquo;Atlantic
Coast Tennis Association Trophy for Girls Under
Eighteen. Doubles. Won by &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/pic3.jpg" alt="It was a Massive Silver Cup." width="500" height="760" />
<p class="center"><i>It was a Massive Silver Cup.</i></p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ohh-h-h!&rdquo; breathed the girls in a delighted
chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it perfectly lov&mdash;e&mdash;ly?&rdquo; gasped
Buster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it must be worth a great deal of
money,&rdquo; cried Hazel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is very beautiful and very expensive,&rdquo;
agreed the guardian. &ldquo;That, Meadow-Brook
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
Girls, is the prize for which you are to
play. Isn&rsquo;t it worth going after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, it is,&rdquo; agreed Jane McCarthy, really
overcome by the magnificence of the trophy cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that look perfectly stunning on our
center tables?&rdquo; exclaimed Buster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our thenter tableth!&rdquo; exploded Tommy.
&ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t in the match at all. Jutht remember
that, Buthter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but she is one of us and will share all
the glory as well as the disappointments of the
Meadow-Brook Girls,&rdquo; answered Harriet reprovingly.
&ldquo;Where shall we put it, girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father will want it on hith library table,
where he can look at it until hith eyethight
failth him,&rdquo; answered Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we shall all want it in our homes,&rdquo; declared
Jane. &ldquo;How are we going to arrange that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might split the cup into five parts and
each take a piece home,&rdquo; suggested Hazel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do. I&rsquo;ll tell you how we shall
arrange it, girls,&rdquo; planned Harriet enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, Harriet knowth what to do,&rdquo; said
Tommy, nodding her tow-head rapidly. &ldquo;Thhe
alwayth knowth everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, we shall place it on exhibition in that
jewelry store on Sycamore Street at home. We
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
shall want everybody to see it, and we shall be
very proud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, and we&rsquo;ll thtand inthide the thtore and
lithten to what they thay about uth, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
bubbled Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, after a day or two, we shall draw lots
to see who has it in her home first. In the beginning
each shall keep it for a day until it goes
the rounds of all our homes. On the next round
each shall keep it for two days and so on, every
round adding a day up to a month. A month
will be long enough for any girl to have it in her
home at a stretch. I&rsquo;ll tell you what we will
do, we will each put in a little money that we
shall earn, and buy one of those black marble
pedestals that are used to hold statues. Then
we can stand the precious cup in the window so
people passing may see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, of course, we must write to our
friends and announce the good news,&rdquo; reminded
Hazel Holland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know one person, at least, who will be
glad to hear of our triumph,&rdquo; declared Harriet.
&ldquo;Grace Harlowe will be delighted to learn that
we&rsquo;ve qualified as champion tennis players.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so will her friends, Nora O&rsquo;Malley and
Anne Pierson and Jessica Bright,&rdquo; chimed in
Marjory. &ldquo;We never dreamed, when we met
those nice girls on our return from the mountains
that we&rsquo;d all become such friends, did
we?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fond of them all, but Grace Harlowe is
my ideal.&rdquo; Harriet spoke with deep conviction.
She had met Grace Harlowe and her
three chums during the preceding summer.
When the Meadow-Brook Girls had passed
through Oakdale on their way home. They had
remained over night with the Wingates, who
were relatives of Tommy Thompson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Hippy Wingate, Tommy&rsquo;s cousin, had risen
to the occasion and invited his particular group
of friends, known as the Eight Originals, of
whom much has been told in the &ldquo;Grace Harlowe
Books,&rdquo; to meet the Meadow-Brook Girls.
These wide-awake young people had spent a
most delightful evening together and a firm
comradeship had sprung up between the two
sets of girls. Harriet and Grace Harlowe had
at once established a permanent bond of fellowship,
so it was hardly to be wondered at that
the former&rsquo;s first thought was of Grace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of courthe we&rsquo;ll let the Oakdale girlths
know what marvelouth championth we are,&rdquo;
nodded Tommy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll thend Grathe a telegram
mythelf the minute the tournament&rsquo;th over,
thaying we&rsquo;ve won the cup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat it?&rdquo; murmured George, chancing
to catch the laughing eyes of the guardian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, George, I confess that I cannot,&rdquo; answered
Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you might want to take the cup with
you right now?&rdquo; suggested the captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could we?&rdquo; asked Tommy innocently,
whereat there was a laugh at her expense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear. There are some little formalities
to be gone through with first,&rdquo; said Harriet.
&ldquo;We first have to win it after battling
with some of the best girl players in the State.
That done, we shall take the cup and carry out
the plans already made. I think we had better
attend to our errands now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; begged Tommy. &ldquo;I could
thtand here and look at it all the retht of the
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started back toward the car. At the
edge of the sidewalk Tommy turned and ran
back to the window. The other girls stepped
into the car and there they sat for fully five
minutes until Tommy Thompson had impressed
every line and curve of the beautiful trophy on
her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may break it if you look at it so hard,&rdquo;
warned George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Tommy. Remember, you must get
your rest and be ready for practice this afternoon,&rdquo;
called the guardian.</p>
<p>The little girl turned away reluctantly, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
getting into the car settled back in the seat, uttering
a deep sigh of happy satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thhall want to look at it all the time. I
know I&rsquo;ll thit up nighth looking at it,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>No one answered her. Each girl was too
deeply absorbed in her thoughts to speak at that
moment. Then the car moved on and the exquisite
trophy for which they were soon to enter
the lists was left behind them. But Harriet resolved
that the separation should not be for
long. Captain George, on his part, took a different
view of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The disappointment will nearly kill them,&rdquo;
he thought.</p>
<h2 id="c18">CHAPTER XVIII
<br /><span class="small">WHAT THE SPY LEARNED</span></h2>
<p>The purchases made, Jane drove at her
usual rate of speed until she reached the
tournament grounds. She slowed down
just long enough to gain the field, then put on
full speed. The car went dashing over the lot,
threatening every minute to upset. She did not
even turn out for a group of workmen. They
were the men who got out of the way, and just in
time, too. No amount of argument on the part
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
of her companions could induce Jane McCarthy
to drive slowly. Of course, she would not have
run over any one recklessly, but in trying to
avoid doing so she might have upset her car and
caused serious injury to her passengers.</p>
<p>The boys were still rolling their practice court
with hand rollers, packing down a lump or digging
it off here and there, giving as much attention
to the task as if the tournament were to be
played on that particular court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a shame for the boys to work so hard,&rdquo;
said Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do them good,&rdquo; answered George carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thaw the cup, Tham,&rdquo; cried Tommy,
leaping from the car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, seeing is believing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And each of uth ith going to have it in her
home. Jutht think of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just think of it,&rdquo; scoffed Sam. &ldquo;Makes me
dizzy to contemplate. Aren&rsquo;t you girls eating
in the middle of the day any more or are you
fasting for the tournament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hadn&rsquo;t thought of luncheon. They had
been absorbed with matters of much greater importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything that looks like a campfire,&rdquo;
said Hazel, glancing about her.</p>
<p>George led the way to the rear of the tents,
where he pointed proudly to a fireplace made of
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
stones. Near it was a pile of dry wood, some
soft for starting the fire, some hard for making
a bed of hot coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you are not fasting, we shall proceed to
get something to eat for you,&rdquo; declared Captain
George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. You have done quite enough.
We will get it ourselves,&rdquo; answered Harriet,
immediately setting about preparing the noonday
meal, which in this instance would be eaten
some time after noon. Her companions put on
their aprons, and half an hour later Tramp Boys
and Meadow-Brook Girls sat down to a light
luncheon.</p>
<p>George told them such other news as he had
learned, the plans for the tournament, how the
names of the players who were to be opposed to
each other were to be drawn, and the like. No
one knew exactly whom she was to play against,
no one would know until the drawings were
made shortly before the game was to be played.
This added a spice to the contest, though that
was not the purpose of the regulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued the captain, &ldquo;in case
you were pitted against such players as the
Scott Sisters, or those high-toned players from
New York City, you might go down and out in
the first set. Then you would be done for, for
good and all this season, without a doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; answered Harriet
promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the laws,&rdquo; answered George with
some warmth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it is quite plain that you do not
know the Meadow-Brook Girls. In the case you
mention it would be the New York girls who
would be done for, for good and all. You are
mistaken, George. But we forgive you. We
know your heart is in the right place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use trying to tell you anything,&rdquo;
objected the captain warmly. &ldquo;You are so stubborn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the way to be?&rdquo; questioned Harriet
Burrell sweetly. &ldquo;Or would you prefer to
have us meek and to say, &lsquo;Oh, yes, the New York
girls will win, of course. We stand no chance,
whatever; we are going to lie right down on the
court and let them have their way&rsquo;? Is that the
way you would like to have me receive your remarks
and answer them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exploded George, &ldquo;not by a jug full.
I withdraw my ungentlemanly remark and beg
your pardon. You are right and I am wrong.
You are always right. Tommy says so and I
agree with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thee, I am the withe one of the outfit,
Mith Elting,&rdquo; spoke up Tommy brightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many prizes are to be offered?&rdquo; asked
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
the guardian, thus putting an end to the subject
the young folks had been discussing. &ldquo;I have
heard nothing about it save the little you and
Mr. Herrington have mentioned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the doubles, you mean? Well, there is
the championship cup&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our cup,&rdquo; cut in Tommy. &ldquo;You know we
are each to have it in our hometh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a smaller cup, too, I believe. There
is also a gold bracelet and a few other consolation
prizes, including a pair of rag dolls for the
ones at the tail end of the procession. How
would you like a nice, homemade rag doll,
Grace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a rag doll, I want a thilver cup&mdash;<i>the</i>
thilver cup,&rdquo; protested Tommy indignantly.
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have a rag doll!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; agreed Harriet. &ldquo;What a
ridiculous idea! We shall have a silver cup,
shan&rsquo;t we, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The</i> thilver cup,&rdquo; corrected Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And how soon will our court be ready
for us, Captain?&rdquo; asked Harriet, turning to the
captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until late this afternoon. You will want
to get settled and rest and adjust yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I shall, for one, want to get to work as
soon as I shall have properly digested my luncheon,&rdquo;
replied Harriet, and then, turning to
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
Charlie Mabie, she added, &ldquo;Charlie, you are actually
getting thin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder. I&rsquo;m doing all the running for
both outfits. Up at the camp in the woods it was
&lsquo;Charlie, run to town and get so and so.&rsquo; Town
was only twelve miles away, but Charlie runs
just the same. Now it will be, &lsquo;Charlie, run over
to town and get a box of candy for the girls.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for these girls,&rdquo; interjected Harriet.
&ldquo;These girls are not eating candy at the present
time. We are living plainly, I would have
you understand. Tommy, I want you to help
me for a little while. You are small and thin.
Do you wish to assist me in working out something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I wish you would stand up and let me
see if I can hit you with the tennis ball. I want
to try an experiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gueth not. You had better try to hit a
tree if you want thomething to hit. I don&rsquo;t like
thuch experimenth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the easy mark,&rdquo; offered Sam. &ldquo;You
may hit me in the face, too, if you want to and
can. Only don&rsquo;t volley for my game nose. It is
still a little tender from the wollop Grace
gave it with her racquet that time. You won&rsquo;t
throw your racquet at me, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, not,&rdquo; answered Harriet with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
merry laugh. &ldquo;I just want to practise for accuracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam posed as a mark for Harriet shortly
after dinner, though she permitted him to try to
avoid her returns. Sam succeeded part of the
time, but not all of the time. Harriet had a little
mystifying way of sending the ball at him and
reaching almost any spot on his body at which
she chose to aim. George said it was because
Sam was too slow to get out of the way. Harriet
smiled but made no denial. There was no regular
practice play, however, until very late in the
afternoon. Then for a time the girls limbered
up on the court while the boys were placing the
net.</p>
<p>Then they decided to play a set. Jane and
Hazel won the first two games of the set, the
other four games going to Harriet and Tommy.
The second set, by agreement, was played much
faster than the first had been. The girls really
disposed of this set with a dash and spirit that
they had not displayed at any other previous
practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&rdquo; declared George.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you had it in you to go through
with it like that. That was a dandy, but not
yet fast enough to win the big cup.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>Harriet laughed at him with that teasing
laugh that always made George feel like chewing
the brim of his hat to keep from making
remarks. Harriet suggested that they play a
slower game this time and try to put into practice
all the tricks they had learned from Mr. Disbrow,
to rehearse everything, in fact, that they
held in reserve for their opponents when the
time came to play the big games.</p>
<p>It was an interesting practice and one who
had been looking on might have gained some
valuable information as to what sort of a game
the Meadow-Brook Girls intended to play in the
tournament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing that we need is a set of signals,&rdquo;
announced Harriet. &ldquo;Now we all play
with our right hands, so I suggest that we agree
upon a certain set of signals to be made with the
left hand as a direction to our playing-mate as
to what to do. These signals must not be overdone,
only used in case of extreme necessity.
Not knowing how we shall be paired off on the
playing day, we must all learn them alike. I
have prepared a few already. We can add others
as they seem to be needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet then explained her signals to her companions,
which each one wrote down at her dictation
while the boys looked on wonderingly.
Sam had gone back to their own camp on an errand
for George, so he was not a party to the
plan. After they had read over their lists, Harriet
went through the signals, requiring the others
to interpret them as she made the signs.
When unable to do so they had but to refer to
their papers. This proved a very short cut to
memorizing the signals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; continued Harriet, &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t be
watching each other all the time for signals, but
there may come moments when an understanding
between the team-mates may be worth a
great deal to each of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether P. E. will approve of
this business or not,&rdquo; said Captain Baker in a
doubtful tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he does not, of course, we shall not use
them,&rdquo; answered Harriet readily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you
what we will do. We will play a game for
him without telling him we are going to use signals,
while all the time we will be signaling to
each other. Then we will tell him and ask his
judgment on the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Now, if you think
you have the signals down pat enough, suppose
you play a game for me, using the signs as you
find you can. You, Jane and Hazel, are not supposed
to know anything about these signals for
this game. Just don&rsquo;t see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A game was played, and several times during
the progress of it Harriet or Tommy made use
of the signals. The other team-mates could not
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
wholly overlook these signals, hence they were
in a measure on their guard for what followed
each time, but the value of signals was so apparent
that George declared himself fully convinced.
He said there could be no doubt as to
how P. E. would view them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you ever think of it, Harriet?&rdquo; he
questioned, gazing at her admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just dreamed them out at home the other
night, but I had forgotten all about it until to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all I&rsquo;ve got to say about it is that you
are a mighty good dreamer. Now, we haven&rsquo;t
much time left before dark, so go ahead and
play. Use your signals, use everything. Work
fast and do your best. There&rsquo;s no one to see
you. No one comes around here. They know
better when we men are on hand to watch over
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite George&rsquo;s boast, however, a young
man had been gradually working his way
through the grove, approaching the tennis court
from the rear of the tents, his stealthy movements
as he darted from tree to tree being
shielded from their view by the tents. As the
shadows grew more dense in the grove he kept
creeping closer. There was still plenty of light
for the players, and their movements were quite
plain to the spy who had stolen upon them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>Reaching a point some little distance removed
from the camp and now to one side of it, a position
that commanded a fairly unobstructed view
of the tennis court, he drew a pair of opera
glasses from his pocket and immediately became
absorbed in watching the playing on the
Meadow-Brook court. Now and then he was
able to hear what was said, but, fortunately,
when discussing the signals the girls and boys
lowered their voices instinctively. If the fellow
had been a keen student of the game he undoubtedly
would have seen that something was
being done that looked like learning a signal
code, but whether or not he understood the
meaning of the natural movements of the left
arms and hands of the players cannot be said.
He had not crept close enough to make his observations
before they began to play.</p>
<p>While all this was going on Sam Crocker had
been to the Tramp Boys&rsquo; camp and was on his
way back. All at once he halted, and, shading
his eyes, gazed at the figure. The fellow&rsquo;s back
was turned toward Sam. Then the latter saw
the opera glasses. He understood at once. Some
one was spying on the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; chuckled Sam, rolling up his sleeves,
&ldquo;here is food for reflection, and food for my
two big fists. Now, Mr. Man, look out for yourself,
for the avenger is certainly on your trail!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>The avenger was. Stooping low and moving
with extreme caution, Sam Crocker crept slowly
up toward the supposed spy, getting nearer and
nearer. All at once, after straightening up, he
uttered a whoop and sprang forward, hurling
himself on the man at the tree.</p>

<br /><span class="small">ON THE TOURNAMENT COURTS</span></h2>
<p>The spy went down, more under the force
of a well-directed blow that Sam had
planted on the back of his neck than
from the force of Sam&rsquo;s weight that fell upon
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him!&rdquo; yelled Sam. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the
miserable spy. Come here, fellows, quick!
Oh-h-h-h! Ouch!&rdquo; There was a despairing
wail in the voice of the Tramp Boy now. The
note of triumph had left it.</p>
<p>Sam&rsquo;s companions had sprung up with his
first call and started into the grove, but though
they could hear their companion they were unable
to locate him.</p>
<p>Sam Crocker&rsquo;s yells were now half smothered,
so it seemed to his companions. Then all
at once they saw Sam rise from the ground,
saw him with both hands clapped to his face,
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
heard his unintelligible yells for help. The boys
ran at top speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; shouted George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch him!&rdquo; moaned Sam, suddenly sitting
down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spy! the spy! He&rsquo;s getting away. He
ran that way. Chase him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys now began to understand. With one
accord they spread out and began running
through the grove, shouting to each other as
they ran, but no trace of Sam&rsquo;s spy did they
find. He had had ample time to make his escape
while Sam was trying to make his companions
understand what had happened.</p>
<p>The girls had dropped their racquets and ran
out, following the boys. They found the unhappy
Sam, hands still pressed against his face, rocking
to and fro and groaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sam, you have hurt your poor nose
again,&rdquo; sympathized Miss Elting. &ldquo;Get a pail
of water. No, we will take him back to camp
where we can give him better treatment,&rdquo; said
the guardian. Sam permitted himself to be
assisted to his feet and slowly led back to the
camp of the Meadow-Brook Girls. Miss Elting
promptly set to work to wash the blood from his
face so that she might determine how serious
was the hurt that he had received.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>It was while she was thus engaged that
George and his companions returned. They
were in none too good humor either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a fine one to send us off on a wild
goose chase like that!&rdquo; growled George. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe you saw any one at all. You must
have seen a shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam found his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at my nose! Does that look as if I
hadn&rsquo;t seen any one? Does my nose look as if I
had met a shadow?&rdquo; he roared, his roar ending
in a groan, for, in opening his mouth, he had
hurt his nose again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us what you did see,&rdquo; urged Baker, his
voice growing sympathetic when he saw that
Sam was suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we shall have to take him to a physician,&rdquo;
announced the guardian. &ldquo;I fear this is
a little beyond my ability as a surgeon. Can&rsquo;t
you wait until he is fixed up, George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but if he&rsquo;s able, he must tell us now,&rdquo;
replied the captain. &ldquo;If there is anything at all
to this we should know it at once. Think you
can talk, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;es, if you won&rsquo;t nag me. Ouch!&rdquo; Sam
remonstrated as the guardian touched his suffering
nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. I won&rsquo;t do it again,&rdquo; said Miss
Elting gravely. &ldquo;I thought that perhaps I
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
might be able to straighten your nose, but see
that is not best, nor had I better put on any adhesive
plaster. The doctor would have to take
it off, thus causing you useless additional pain.
Tell them, please, if you are going to do so. We
must get you to a doctor at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming through the grove when I discovered
a fellow hiding behind a tree,&rdquo; explained
Sam Crocker with many a halt and
groan. &ldquo;I crawled up toward him. I didn&rsquo;t like
his looks. Then I saw he had a pair of opera
glasses. Through the glasses he was watching
the girls at practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; shouted George. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you
tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, but you thought I had seen shadows.
Shadows don&rsquo;t give a fellow this,&rdquo; he added,
pointing to his own disreputable nose. &ldquo;When
I got up close enough I jumped upon him. I
punched him at the same time. He went down
and I on top of him. It looked like a soft thing
for me. I yelled to you boys about that time.
But Fate was against me. Do you know, that
fellow knew all about my sore nose, knew that it
was the one particular tender, sensitive spot on
my whole body. The scoundrel jerked his elbow
back just like this. It hit me on the nose and
made me yell. Oh, it hurt awfully. I just rolled
right off him and clapped both hands to my poor
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
nose. It was bleeding badly. Then the fellow
jumped up. I made a grab for him; then, what
do you suppose he did? He kicked me in the
nose, kicked me right on the sorest spot in my
whole body. I don&rsquo;t mind being kicked, but to
be insulted by being kicked on the nose&mdash;that&rsquo;s
<i>too</i> much for a self-respecting Tramp. If you
catch him, don&rsquo;t do anything to him. Just bring
him to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you know the fellow if you were to
see him again?&rdquo; questioned George, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I think so, although I saw his
face only for a second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was he dressed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had on a pair of shoes, heavy ones,&rdquo; was
Sam&rsquo;s innocent reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of suit?&rdquo; persisted George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t notice it. Don&rsquo;t think I saw it at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, this is serious,&rdquo; declared Captain
Baker, turning to his fellow Tramps. &ldquo;Some
one has been spying while the girls were at practice.
We should have posted guards, but I
didn&rsquo;t think we should be bothered this afternoon.
There are some queer people around
here. Of course, we can&rsquo;t blame them for wanting
to know all they can, but we may blame ourselves
for letting them find out. We shall see to
it, however, that this incident is not repeated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he saw our signals!&rdquo; gasped
Jane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, no doubt. We were making them
about that time. But, girls, keep your eyes
open. If the boys don&rsquo;t catch the guilty ones,
we shall undoubtedly do so when we get in the
tournament. If this spying has been done in the
interest of any of the players, the girls will
know our signals when we face the net,&rdquo; declared
Harriet. &ldquo;The spy may not have heard
our explanations, but if he is sharp he will be
able to identify the signals with the plays that
follow. When any of you sees that her opponents
understand our signals you will know you
are getting close to the fellow who hurt Sam&rsquo;s
nose. Then you just watch. Are you going to
send him to a doctor, Miss Elting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take him in the motor car,&rdquo; said Jane.</p>
<p>It was arranged in that way, Miss Elting and
Captain George accompanying the injured boy,
who really was suffering more than he ever remembered
to have suffered in all his life. The
other Tramp Boys remained with the Meadow-Brook
Girls. The boys were angry and the girls
indignant at the attack on Sam Crocker, but
there was nothing to be done in the matter now
except to wait and watch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Sam was brought back in Jane&rsquo;s car. His
face was plastered until he was well-nigh unrecognizable,
but it was the same old familiar voice
that inquired if supper were ready. The girls
had forgotten all about the meal. Their minds
had not been on eating at any stage of this
eventful day. They hurriedly set about preparing
a meal for themselves and the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor says he will not be permanently
disfigured,&rdquo; Harriet informed her companions.
&ldquo;Of course, he must not get any more such
knocks on the nose. It&rsquo;s too bad, now that the
tournament is on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my voice left,&rdquo; answered Sam. &ldquo;I
can yell, and now that the plasters are there to
hold my nose in place I won&rsquo;t crack my face
doing so. I&rsquo;m going to do some yelling. Another
fellow may be heard to yell, too, but he
won&rsquo;t yell in the same tone, not if I lay my gentle
hands upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls were tired and they were to have a
long day&rsquo;s practice on the following day, so the
boys were permitted to go to their own camp at
an early hour in the evening. There the Tramps
discussed ways and means of trapping the spy
and giving him the thrashing he deserved, not so
much on account of his having spied on them as
because of his brutal kicking of Sam Crocker.
The elbow jolt was necessary in order to free
himself, but the kick in the nose was not. It was
the kick that he should be punished for, the lads
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
decided, after sitting in judgment on the matter
for a long time. They, too, went to bed with
their minds fully made up as to what they would
do when they found the man. It would not have
been a pleasant prospect for him had he known.</p>
<p>Next morning Harriet was out at daylight.
Shortly afterward she saw the men setting the
nets on the tournament courts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is our chance, girls,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The
nets are being placed. Get ready and we can
have a long practice before the rest of the community
is stirring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some grumbling, but Harriet being
recognized as the leader among the girls, her
suggestions were usually adopted. They were
in this instance and were warmly seconded by
the guardian. As soon as they could get ready
they did so and were off across the fields, each
eating a piece of bread. There were no Tramp
Boys in sight at that early hour, only the workmen
and a manager who was directing the placing
of the nets on measurements already laid
down. Jack Herrington had reasoned that some
of the contestants might desire early practice
and, to give them all an opportunity, had ordered
the nets set up at daybreak.</p>
<p>Miss Elting asked permission to use the
courts, which was granted; then the girls began
a game, after first having warmed up, for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
morning was chill. There being no one to see
them except the men at work, they did not hesitate
to use all their tricks and secret plays, making
good use of the signals all through the set.
Harriet and Tommy won the first game, Hazel
and Jane the next.</p>
<p>Acting upon the suggestion of the guardian
the girls were not playing fast games that morning,
but instead they were playing for accuracy
and perfection. They were devoting a great
deal of attention these days to form, seeking to
make their movements as graceful and artistic
as possible and yet obtain the best results from
their playing. In this instance Miss Elting was
their critic.</p>
<p>So interested were the Meadow-Brook Girls
in their work that they failed to see a man climb
the fence from the street and cross the lot toward
the courts. His approach was shielded by
the stand built for the tournament spectators.
They were unaware of his presence as he stood
behind the stand, where he watched the whole of
the second set. Then to their amazement he
suddenly appeared before them, having walked
around to the front of the stand without attracting
attention to himself until Harriet Burrell
had called &ldquo;Game!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX
<br /><span class="small">A WELCOME DISTURBANCE</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Caught red-handed,&rdquo; cried a familiar
voice.</p>
<p>Margery uttered a little scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thave me!&rdquo; cried Tommy, dropping her
racquet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to have frightened you, ladies, but
glad that it was I who did it rather than some
one else,&rdquo; he said, stepping forward, laughing
heartily at their confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Disbrow,&rdquo; cried Harriet. &ldquo;Oh, we
are glad to see you. How long have you been
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the beginning of the set. You should
be more cautious. How did you know but that
one of your opponents might be watching and
getting pointers from your practice? You certainly
have been applying all the instruction I
gave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mistake,&rdquo; agreed Miss Elting. &ldquo;We
were all too absorbed to think that any one
might be looking on. How did you get here so
early?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just arrived, and, after leaving my bag at
the hotel, thought I would walk over and have a
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
look at the courts. It is too early for breakfast
at the hotel, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad. You will now have breakfast
with us. The boys have not yet arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not expect to see them,&rdquo; chuckled Disbrow.
&ldquo;But tell me, what is new? What do you
hear about the other contestants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet told him all that they had learned
from George Baker, to all of which Mr. Disbrow
listened gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have heard as much. It seems a foregone
conclusion that the Scott Sisters are going
to win the cup. From what I have been able to
learn they are accomplished players and have
been in training for this match ever since early
in the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; Harriet&rsquo;s eyebrows elevated ever so
little. &ldquo;You have lost your confidence in the
Meadow-Brook Girls, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means. From what I have just seen
here you girls will give a most excellent account
of yourselves, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you
will win the cup. I do not see how you could
even hope to do so after the very brief time you
have spent at the nets. Had you finished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were going back to camp, but we will
put on another game if you like,&rdquo; replied Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would. You may not find another
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
opportunity when no others are about. After
this afternoon I shouldn&rsquo;t do more than just
keep in good form. I mean, do no hard work on
the court. Now, if you are ready, you may play
a couple of games, keeping the same partners,
and paying especial attention to team work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did so, Harriet Burrell&rsquo;s side winning
each time, the two games being watched keenly
by the Englishman, but without comment until
the games were finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, <i>very</i> good!&rdquo; he cried, with something
more than the usual praise in his voice. &ldquo;I
am satisfied that you have done a great deal
more than really could be expected of you. In
fact, I may say that I would not have deemed it
possible for novices to get in such form as you
are showing in so short a time. Do not set your
hopes too high, but get as near the top as you
can. I shall make it a point to circulate among
the players who are here and renew old acquaintances.
I may have something further to
say on the matter this evening. Oh, no, I am not
going to spy on our opponents. I merely want
to hear from persons who know what the others
have been doing, how they are showing up as to
form and skill. I think I shall accept your invitation
to breakfast with you. This air has given
me an appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a very good court at the camp,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
said Miss Elting after the party had started
for camp. &ldquo;The boys have worked like Trojans
to put it in excellent shape. It is a dirt court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good. They are a fine lot of boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, and Tham bumped hith nothe,&rdquo;
Tommy informed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I hear. Poor Samuel. He is a most unfortunate
mortal, but he is all to the good. That
is a fine location for you. You should have some
place in which to rest, however. You will have
seven minutes after each third set, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The teams are to have dressing tents near
the courts if they wish,&rdquo; answered Harriet Burrell.
&ldquo;Mr. Baker is going to put up one for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old George!&rdquo; approved Mr. Disbrow.</p>
<p>At breakfast, which was a hearty meal in the
case of the champion, he offered his criticisms
of their playing that morning, making valuable
suggestions and giving them a series of instructions
regarding their playing when the real test
was at hand&mdash;that of standing up before hundreds
of people and yet being wholly unconscious
of their presence.</p>
<p>The conversation was continued after breakfast,
then the girls told him of their code of signals.
Disbrow said he had observed them when
they were playing the second set while he was
watching from behind the stand. He agreed
that it was an excellent idea provided they did
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
not give too much attention to watching for signals
and thus overlook the more important
things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harriet ith going to let uth have the thilver
polithh and cloth for the cup,&rdquo; interjected
Tommy wholly irrelevantly to the subject under
discussion.</p>
<p>Mr. Disbrow laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sincerely hope you may have use for the
silver polish,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;To-morrow, I believe,
the singles are to be played off. You should
see all of them and study the methods of the
players critically, especially those whom you are
to face in the courts next day. Here come the
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s P. E.!&rdquo; shouted George the instant he
caught sight of the Englishman sitting in the
camp. The boys welcomed him boisterously,
then George poured out all the news he had obtained.
Later on he accompanied Mr. Disbrow
to his hotel, where the two discussed the chances
of the Meadow-Brook Girls. Neither the champion
nor the boy saw any reason to change their
opinions on this subject. That the girls might
make an excellent showing they agreed, but that
they stood any chance at all of winning the
championship neither believed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is simply an impossibility,&rdquo; declared P.
E. with emphasis. &ldquo;I wish I might look at it in
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
a different light. Perhaps we may change our
minds after we see what the other people have
been doing, but I doubt it. Have you seen any
of the others play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>George said he had not, but that he had some
confidential reports on the work of the Fifth
Avenues and the Riversides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are they?&rdquo; questioned Disbrow eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot stuff,&rdquo; answered George, &ldquo;but very
fancy. My, but they handle their racquets well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make a champion,&rdquo;
suggested Disbrow thoughtfully. &ldquo;But we shall
see. I shall hope to have further information
by this evening and still more to-morrow. I say,
if I shouldn&rsquo;t get back before dark, see that the
girls play a couple of sets&mdash;light practice, mind
you&mdash;after four o&rsquo;clock this afternoon. And
don&rsquo;t let them work too hard during the heat of
the afternoon. They are pretty fit physically
now and I don&rsquo;t want them to lose form. I
think it is safe to say that no team in the tournament
will enter the courts in better physical condition
than the Meadow-Brooks. They are simply
wonderful physically. I leave you to look
after these things as I do not wish to take an
active part. It would not be best for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George agreed. All arrangements having
been talked over and understood between George
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
and Mr. Disbrow, they separated, George to return
to camp, the Englishman to spend the day
among the tennis people, many of whom he
knew, for the tournament had drawn as spectators
tennis players of high and low degree.</p>
<p>Almost every person was talking tennis and
discussing the merits of the respective teams.
Of the Meadow-Brooks little was known. Some
had heard of them, most had not, nor had
the girls appeared on the streets of the town
enough to be identified and placed. They were
too busy with the serious affairs in hand to
spend any time wandering about the summer resort
in idle pleasure.</p>
<p>Every train that arrived during the day
brought with it players and visitors. Early in
the forenoon girls in white sweaters might have
been seen at practice on the tournament courts.
The Meadow-Brook Girls were at no time among
them, nor were the Scott Sisters nor the Fifth
Avenues and Riversides. The latter two were
practising on their own private courts and the
former were staying with friends and resting
preparatory to the battle to be fought perhaps
on the morrow.</p>
<p>It was after dinner that evening before Earlington
Disbrow turned his footsteps toward the
Meadow-Brook camp. He was not highly elated
over what he had learned that day, but showed
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
nothing of this in his face or manner when he
called on the girls. The boys were still there.</p>
<p>George reported that the girls had had a very
satisfactory day&rsquo;s practice, but that the Tramps
had had difficulty in keeping spectators and curious
players away from the place. The Tramps
had literally thrown a circle about the Meadow-Brook
Girls&rsquo; court, permitting no one to pass
within the circle while practice was in progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they play to-morrow?&rdquo; questioned Dill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Mr. Herrington does not think it advisable.
It will undoubtedly be late in the afternoon
before the singles are run off, so he has decided
to start the doubles on the following forenoon
at ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you wish on the question of team-mates?&rdquo;
he asked, turning to Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been leaving that to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will offer my suggestion. I have
talked it over with George and he agrees with
me. I believe the best results can be obtained by
arranging it as follows, Miss Burrell and Miss
Thompson to play together, Miss McCarthy and Miss
Holland to act as team-mates. Of course,
Miss Thompson is not as heavy as I wish she
were, but she makes up for that in a measure by
her alertness. Have you any objections to the
arrangement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed not,&rdquo; answered the guardian. &ldquo;You
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
have expressed my own ideas on the question.
None of the girls has expressed any preference,
but I know they will be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I for one am,&rdquo; answered Harriet promptly.
The other girls announced themselves as pleased
with the arrangement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will call it settled. I wish we might
be drawn so that you girls could play the weaker
teams first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do not wish any favoritism,&rdquo; declared
Harriet. &ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t win fairly and on our
merits, we prefer to be beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the sportsman-like spirit. That is
the spirit that should prevail in all contests, as I
am certain it will in this. You are going to be in
hot company. I have learned something more
about the playing of the Scott Sisters. They are
fine players. I am not belittling your work,
mind you. You play a splendid game&mdash;a marvelous
game for the time you have been practising,
but you must remember that one has to go
through a few public matches before one learns
to play well before people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, we underthtand,&rdquo; nodded Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think we shall not win?&rdquo; questioned
Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not wish to discourage you, nor do I
think you will so construe what I have to say. I
think you will play a very fine game and that you
<span class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
will not win the booby prize, but as for winning
the cup, for the life of me I don&rsquo;t see how you
are going to do it. There! It&rsquo;s out now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are one of those perthonth who have to
be thhown, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; lisped Tommy Thompson
after a moment of deep silence following the
discouraging announcement. &ldquo;I gueth that we
thhall have to thhow you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI
<br /><span class="small">A DISASTER IN CAMP</span></h2>
<p>The morning following the conversation
between the Meadow-Brook Girls and
Earlington Disbrow dawned clear and
cool, though the weather gave promise of being
much hotter&mdash;in fact, the Weather Bureau had
promised the hottest wave of the summer thus
far, which the management of the tournament
advanced as an added reason why every one
should come to the seashore for the Coast Tennis
Tournament.</p>
<p>The girls, in no way cast down by the doubts
expressed by their instructor, were still full of
determination to win or go down with colors
flying to the breeze. That was the Meadow-Brook
spirit. Now that each girl had been assigned
her partner, the two teams got together
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
and planned out the methods to be used by each
of the two teams&mdash;in fact, planned everything
that could be planned. It was the first public
appearance of any of the girls of the Meadow-Brook
camp, hence their behavior when they
found themselves on the courts was still an unknown
quantity. However, instead of worrying
over their ordeal the girls had a lively round at
their own net early in the morning before breakfast,
then a cold bath, after which they were
ready for breakfast.</p>
<p>They were alone, that morning, for breakfast,
and enjoyed themselves very much. Only
Tommy appeared to be nervous, but she soon
forgot this in talking about the cup that she confidently
believed would be in their possession
on the following day.</p>
<p>They were not to play any more until after
they had returned from the singles that were
to be run off on this, the first day of the tournament.
Mr. Disbrow they would not see again
until they had reached the tournament grounds,
but George and at least one of his companions
were coming over to accompany Miss Elting and
the girls to the tournament. The girls were
looking forward to the arrival of their own parents,
all except Harriet Burrell, who thought
her father and mother would not be present. In
a way she was glad of it, though she knew she
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
should miss them, that she would give almost
anything were they able to see her play and enjoy
the proud distinction which she hoped and
believed would come to her and her companions.
But she was wise enough to keep nothing on her
mind from that time until the end of the games,
save the games themselves.</p>
<p>They repaired to the tennis grounds about an
hour before the calling of the games. None of
the girls shared the comforts of the grand stand.
They preferred to be on the ground, where they
could stroll about, where they could be close
enough to watch and learn. That they did learn
a great deal that day they admitted later on, for
there were some excellent sets played in the
singles. During the morning Mr. Disbrow came
to them with a copy of the &ldquo;draw&rdquo; which had
been made that morning, showing the assignments
of the teams for the preliminary games in
the doubles. The Meadow-Brook Girls perused
the list eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, listen to this! Jane and Hazel play the
Riversides first,&rdquo; cried Harriet excitedly;
&ldquo;and, Tommy, you and I are listed to play our
first match against the Fifth Avenues. That is
what will happen if both these teams win in their
preliminary matches, which, of course, they are
bound to do. I don&rsquo;t like to have to sit and wait
until those preliminaries are over, but some one
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
must do it, I suppose. Some one always has to
suffer for another person&rsquo;s gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am well pleased that both of you do not
have to meet the top-notchers the first thing,&rdquo;
said Mr. Disbrow. &ldquo;The meeting with a team
nearer your own class will give you a chance to
get a notch or two higher than you might otherwise
attain. Miss Burrell and Miss Thompson
will have an added disadvantage. They must
try to profit by your experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dithbrow, may I thay thomething perthonal?&rdquo;
asked Tommy sweetly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will thay it. You are a regular calamity
howler. I thaid you were one of thothe
perthonth who had to be thhown. Wait until to-morrow
and we&rsquo;ll thhow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Englishman doffed his hat politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are right, but perhaps I have
had a motive in saying those things that you call
&lsquo;calamity howling.&rsquo; However, I shall explain
what I mean after the games to-morrow. Watch
this set; it is going to be a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are either of the top-notchers whom we are
to meet playing in the singles?&rdquo; whispered Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Like yourselves, they are lying low and
conserving their energies. The Scott Sisters
I have not seen, nor the other two teams we have
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
spoken of. I don&rsquo;t know that any of them are on
the grounds, though I presume they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the next hour there was little opportunity
for conversation. The play held the attention
of the Meadow-Brook Girls, Mr. Disbrow
remaining near them, now and then calling
their attention to improper plays or some particularly
fine bit of playing that he wished them
to impress upon their minds.</p>
<p>A very large crowd of people was in attendance;
a greater attendance, even, was looked for
on the morrow. Every player had hosts of
friends to cheer for her and to shout encouraging
words between the sets. The games were
run off quickly, only two sets being long-drawn
out when skilful players found themselves opposed
to each other. Even these were limited
to half an hour&rsquo;s playing. The playing day
ended about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, some
contestants having made a miserable showing,
others having shown such form as gave promise
of future successes.</p>
<p>Mr. Disbrow went to camp to take dinner with
the Meadow-Brook Girls as well as to watch
their practice, which was to take place immediately
upon their return to camp. He did not
compliment them on their work that afternoon,
but before leaving them that night he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, no work to-morrow morning.
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
Sleep as late as you can comfortably and do not
lie awake thinking of to-morrow. Time enough
to think when you are before the net. Just try
to imagine that it is a practice game with your
humble instructor on the side lines ready to criticise
you sharply for any shortcomings he may
observe. Try to think, too, that there is nothing
worth while at stake, even if you do not win
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, there ith,&rdquo; objected Tommy. &ldquo;There
ith a cup at thtake. I call that thomething.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may look in on you after breakfast to see
that you are all in working order,&rdquo; continued
Disbrow. &ldquo;George, as the manager of the team,
I would suggest that you see Herrington at nine
o&rsquo;clock in the morning to see that there are no
changes in the arrangements. Miss Elting, it
will be for you and Miss Brown to look after the
physical comfort of the young ladies when they
come in from the sets. You understand what to
do, being an athlete yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guardian nodded understandingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, good-bye until to-morrow. Remember!&rdquo;
He shook a warning finger at the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall not forget,&rdquo; answered Harriet
simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel,&rdquo; said Tommy, after he had gone,
&ldquo;jutht ath though I were going to jail to-morrow.
Thuppothe&mdash;thuppothe a girl thhould defeat
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
me and I thhould throw my racquet at her
and hit her on the nothe&mdash;would they thend me
to jail for that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy!&rdquo; exclaimed Harriet, &ldquo;how can you
say such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can thay it all right. What I want to know
ith may I do it, if I want to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You most certainly may not,&rdquo; answered
Miss Elting sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; decided the little girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; returned Harriet,
breaking out into a merry peal of laughter.</p>
<p>The boys remained in the camp for an hour
after the departure of Mr. Disbrow, when they,
too, prepared to go to their own camp. George
promised that the boys would be over early. In
the meantime the dressing tent would be pitched
and made ready for them, so that the girls
might go directly to their dressing tent from
their camp. There they could rest until they
were called for their turn, all of which George
would attend to personally, removing any necessity
for worry about arrangements.</p>
<p>The boys bade their friends good night, shaking
hands with each girl and the guardian before
leaving, then strode away in the darkness.
The girls retired very shortly after the departure
of the boys. All were weary, nor did they
feel much like talking that evening. Miss Elting
kissed each of them good night, and within
fifteen minutes every Meadow-Brook girl was
sound asleep. Healthy minds and healthy bodies
had much to do with this.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>Late that night, well past midnight, Harriet
was awakened by the sound of thunder. As she
opened her eyes a vivid flash of lightning caused
her to close them again sharply. She got up
quietly and secured the tent flap, then crawled
back under her blanket. The rain was not long
in coming. A heavy shower fell. She wondered
if this would prevent the game on the morrow,
but she was too sleepy to dwell long on the
thought, and dropped into a doze a moment
later.</p>
<p>The awakening from that doze was a sudden
one. The wind was blowing and the rain causing
a great commotion in the foliage of the trees,
when all at once one side of the tent tilted up.
The whole stretch of canvas was suddenly lifted
from them and hurled against a tree trunk, about
which the wet canvas wrapped itself.</p>
<p>In almost an instant the Meadow-Brook Girls
were soaked to the skin. They sprang up with
cries of alarm. The night was very dark, except
when a flash of lightning lighted up the deserted
field that only a few hours before had been peopled
with pleasure-lovers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thave me!&rdquo; cried little Tommy shrilly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Oh, I&rsquo;m getting wet,&rdquo;
groaned Margery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is the matter&mdash;not with us. It&rsquo;s the
tent that is in trouble. The wind has blown it
over, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; answered Harriet calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your blankets around you. You simply
must not get wet,&rdquo; commanded the guardian.
&ldquo;Oh, this is too bad&mdash;and on the night
before the tournament,&rdquo; she added under her
breath with a little groan, unheard by her
charges. For an hour they sat shivering, wet to
the skin, unable to do a thing to help themselves
until the wind and rain had ceased.</p>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII
<br /><span class="small">AN EXCITING MORNING</span></h2>
<p>It was not an encouraging situation. Within
a few hours the four girls were to enter
upon the most momentous undertaking of
their lives,&mdash;an undertaking that would require
them to be in fit physical condition, with clear
heads, alert and supple in limb. And here they
sat in a blinding rainstorm with nothing more
substantial than their blankets between them
and the heavy downpour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no game for you girls to-morrow,&rdquo;
groaned Margery Brown, dismally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If there is a game, we shall play,&rdquo; answered
Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; cried Jane. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all
catch cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the rain stops we shall put the tent
up again,&rdquo; returned Harriet Burrell. &ldquo;That
question is easily answered, but answering is the
easiest part of it. The worst feature of it is that
all our clothes will be out of shape and unfit to
wear in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to make the best of it,&rdquo; said
the guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will iron them in the morning,&rdquo; replied
Harriet. &ldquo;We must, for the sake of our friends,
make a half-way decent appearance. You saw
how neat and well groomed all the players
looked to-day. With our dark clothes it will be
even more difficult to make ourselves presentable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I withh the boyth were here,&rdquo; lisped
Tommy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. We are perfectly able to take care
of ourselves. What we must wish for is the
rain to cease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No signs of its doing so were observable. They
sat, dismal and forlorn, wrapped in their blankets,
each girl sitting in a puddle of water, for
there was no floor in their tent.</p>
<p>Harriet soon saw that remaining as they
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
were might be attended with serious results.
She urged the girls to get up and walk about,
which suggestion the guardian seconded. Then
for the next hour they walked back and forth,
keeping well out in the open field, fearing that
were they to take refuge under the trees they
might be struck by lightning.</p>
<p>About three o&rsquo;clock in the morning the rain
suddenly stopped. Soon after that the clouds
broke away and the stars came out. The faint
light of the coming day enabled them to see with
some distinctness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the tent, girls,&rdquo; cried Harriet. &ldquo;I
wish we had a fire or a lantern. But we shall
have light from the skies soon. Help me spread
the tent on the ground and straighten it out,
Jane, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they were doing this the other girls
were placing their belongings on higher ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, joy!&rdquo; shouted Hazel. &ldquo;All our dresses
were in the chest. Who put them there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; answered Tommy. &ldquo;I have thenthe
thometimeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A weak cheer greeted this announcement.
Their dresses were dry, after all. Much of their
trouble being thus banished the girls&rsquo; spirits
rose, and soon thereafter they were laughing
and chattering, unmindful of their bedraggled
and thoroughly uncomfortable condition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Suddenly Jane McCarthy uttered a cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ropes are broken&mdash;broken right off near
the stakes, I should judge,&rdquo; she called excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is strange,&rdquo; replied Harriet. &ldquo;The
ropes are too strong to break so easily. The
stakes would have pulled up before the ropes
would break. Let me see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet took the end of a guy-rope that Jane
extended toward her, and looked at it closely.
She ran to where the tent had been pitched and
began tugging at a stake, which came up after
no little effort on her part. This stake she carried
back to Jane and held it before her companion,
a piece of the broken rope dangling from
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, Jane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, darlin&rsquo;, didn&rsquo;t I tell you? The rope
broke off just as I said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, Jane, dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh, what?&rdquo; exclaimed Jane. &ldquo;Then what
did happen to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rope didn&rsquo;t break off, at least not wholly
so. It has been cut nearly in two with a sharp
knife. I presume we shall find the other ropes
in a similar condition. Whoever did it must
have known that a storm was coming and
thought that the first good puff of wind would
leave us without a roof over our heads. Now,
what do you think of that, Jane McCarthy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The miserable cowards!&rdquo; raged Jane.
&ldquo;Miss Elting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others of the party were quickly made acquainted
with what Harriet had discovered.
Then there followed an immediate examination
of the other guy-ropes, all being found partly
severed by a knife. The uneven, stringy ends
showed where the break had come when the wind
blew hard enough to part them.</p>
<p>This was a new element of discomfort and
mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand who would do such a
thing,&rdquo; pondered Harriet Burrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys wouldn&rsquo;t play that trick on us,
would they?&rdquo; questioned Margery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed they would not. This is not fun;
this is malice, nothing less,&rdquo; declared Harriet.
&ldquo;I am afraid we have enemies here, girls, but
whoever they are we are going to triumph over
them to-morrow, even if we have to go to the
courts soaked to the skin and out of condition
as the result of our night&rsquo;s experiences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light was now strong enough to enable
them to make out objects about them quite
clearly. They examined the ground. They found
the imprint of boots in the soft turf all around
where the tent had stood, but whether these had
been made by one of the boys or by their midnight
visitor they were unable to say. They
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
were strongly inclined to the opinion that it was
the enemy who had put them in such a plight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we shall put up the tent now,&rdquo;
said Miss Elting, after reflection. &ldquo;It is now
nearly daylight. The boys will be along soon.
They will set the camp to rights. There go two
of them now to put up the dressing tent.
Whoo-e-e-e!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sam and Dill Dodd halted at the hail. They
saw instantly that something was wrong at the
Meadow-Brook camp and came over at a trot.
The situation was explained in a few words.
Sam started on a run for his own camp to inform
George Baker, and in an almost incredibly
short time George came in sight with Sam
Crocker trailing along a few rods behind him.</p>
<p>The girls had never seen George in a rage before.
But his rage took a different form from
what they might have expected. His face was
very pale and his voice was so calm as to be almost
gentle. Yet there was a note of restraint
in it, of enforced control, that told the girls he
was laboring under great excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam, skate back and tell the fellows to get
our tent in shape. Tell them the girls will be
along in a few moments,&rdquo; he ordered, and Sam
went obediently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; protested Harriet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to our camp to turn in, all
of you. Miss Elting, you will see that they go
to bed and get some rest, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see. The grounds are wet this morning.
I do not think the games will be called
much before eleven o&rsquo;clock. You may safely
sleep until nine o&rsquo;clock. That will give you two
hours in which to get ready. If there is any
change in the time I will have you called earlier
or later as needed, so don&rsquo;t worry one little bit.
This ground is too wet for you to sleep on, that
is why I am sending you to our camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you planning to do, put up our
tent?&rdquo; questioned Miss Elting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the ground dries off, yes. Just now I
am going to see Jack Herrington, then call on
P. E. How do the girls seem to be feeling?&rdquo;
George lowered his voice so that only the guardian
might hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In excellent condition, I should say. You
know a little wetting doesn&rsquo;t disturb them very
much. I hope they play the games to-day. The
grounds will be wet and somehow I believe our
girls will make a better showing on soft, soggy
grounds than on a smooth, hard court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking of that myself,&rdquo; answered
George confidentially. &ldquo;Well, so long for a few
hours. I have business on hand this morning,
being business manager of the Meadow-Brook
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
team. Sounds important, doesn&rsquo;t it? May not
sound so important to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George started across the field. His chin was
lowered almost to his chest and he was raging
inwardly at the indignity put upon the Meadow-Brook
Girls. He would see to it that nothing
of the sort occurred again. He censured himself
because he had not thrown a guard about
the camp on the evening before the battle. It
was too late now for regrets. The one great
question now uppermost in the minds of a hundred
or more persons besides himself was, who
was going to win the doubles?</p>
<p>So far as George Baker was able to judge, the
Scott Sisters were slated for this victory. Disbrow
agreed with him, basing his judgment on
what he had heard of the sisters and what he had
seen of the Meadow-Brook Girls. Harriet and
her companions, as the reader already knows,
were confident of a great victory. The odds
seemed to be heavily against them, however;
hard luck certainly was on their side, as the incidents
of the night just past plainly indicated.</p>
<p>Jack Herrington was very angry when he
learned what had happened to the ambitious
girls, but there was nothing he could do except
promise to see to it that the guilty one would
be punished, provided he were ever caught,
which seemed doubtful. Mr. Disbrow shook his
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
head sadly. He said the effects of that wetting
might not show until the girls were on the court,
but that they would surely suffer from it.</p>
<p>The tournament was not to be postponed. It
was to be started at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
even if the courts were not dry. The sky was
still overcast and the sun had not yet come out,
though the air was sultry and close.</p>
<p>George sent a messenger to the Tramp Boys
to have the girls called at eight o&rsquo;clock and to
tell them the games would be called on time.
The active young man visited the courts, there
to stand stroking his chin as he looked over the
battle ground reflectively, consulted the skies,
decided in his own mind which would be the favorable
end of the courts with reference to the
sun in case his side won the choice of sides. He
considered everything, showing that Captain
George Baker was a long-headed young man
well worthy to be the leader of the band of hardy
lads whose commander he was.</p>
<p>While he was thus engaged, two young women
clad in raincoats, their heads enveloped in
the hoods of the coats, came out on the field.
They appeared to be very much interested in
the courts, which they tested by stepping on
them, taking note of the slipperiness, the
stickiness and other features of the courts,
they shook their heads disapprovingly. George
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
decided that they were players&mdash;players, too,
who appeared to know their business. Once
they had whispered together while looking
at him. He knew they were speaking of
him, which made the young man rather ill at
ease. He watched them leave the field. Asking
one of the men who had come to work on the
courts who these young women were, Captain
Baker learned that they were the Scott Sisters,
which information did not tend to strengthen his
hopes for his team.</p>
<p>There being nothing more to be done, George
went back to his own camp, where he knew
breakfast would be awaiting him. The other lads
had put up the dressing tent and were now carrying
in boards for a floor, the ground being too
wet to be used as a floor.</p>
<p>It was nearly eight o&rsquo;clock when the captain
reached his camp. He found the girls up and
dressed. They greeted him brightly, but he
thought there was something forced in their
gayety. The captain did not blame them
for this. They were laboring under a great
strain&mdash;in fact, the greatest they had ever experienced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>Before eating breakfast the team took a limbering-up
exercise, consisting of forward and
backward bends, skipping the rope, a rapid
round with half-pound dumb bells, wrist exercises
with light Indian clubs, and other exercises
calculated to put in condition every muscle
in their bodies. They went through their morning
work without a hitch, finishing with flushed
faces and sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is good to be alive, even if one had to
sit in a puddle of water most of the night,&rdquo; declared
Harriet, as they sat down to breakfast.
&ldquo;Eat sparingly, girls, and chew your food well.
That was Mr. Disbrow&rsquo;s advice. We are to have
some dry biscuit to nibble if we feel hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margery and Miss Elting had taken an earlier
breakfast and hurried over to the Meadow-Brook
camp to gather up the necessary articles
for the battle. These were packed in a chest
which the boys carried to the dressing tent, one
of them remaining on guard over the stuff.
George did not propose to have their mysterious
enemy playing any more tricks.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock they started for the battle
ground. The sun had come out broiling hot, the
ground was steaming, the air full of humidity,
a most depressing condition for those who were
to participate in the great tennis match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel ath though I were going to a funeral,&rdquo;
declared Tommy dismally, as they plodded along
over the wet turf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII
<br /><span class="small">A MEMORABLE BATTLE</span></h2>
<p>As the Meadow-Brook Girls neared the
grounds they saw that great throngs
were there, while a constant stream of
spectators poured across the field. Now that
the sun had come out, nearly every one was
dressed in white. The stand was still nearly
empty, the seats there being sold by numbers,
making it unnecessary for the ticket holders to
come early in order to get a seat.</p>
<p>George was waiting for the girls at their tent,
to which they went directly and, disappearing
within, were seen no more until Jane and Hazel
were called for their match. Their entrance
had attracted no attention, however, as little was
known concerning them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are the courts?&rdquo; was Harriet&rsquo;s first
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slippery as a skating rink,&rdquo; answered
George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as fair for one as another,&rdquo; reflected
Harriet, nodding. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I mind it
particularly. Not very nice for white shoes,
though, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you may go out,&rdquo; said the guardian.
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
&ldquo;We must get the girls ready. I will let you
know as soon as we have finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George promptly stepped outside. In front
of the tent stood Charlie Mabie on guard.
George directed him to permit no one to come
near the tent until the guardian had notified
him they were ready, and then only the friends
of the party. There was little left to be done in
the dressing. They took off their muddy shoes,
putting on tennis shoes in place of the others.</p>
<p>There was but little talking in the dressing
tent, but outside a great wave of conversation
rose, reaching the tent in a confused
murmur. The girls were rather pale, but this
might be the result of the trying night through
which they had passed. Harriet pulled herself
together and began a series of cheerful remarks.
She soon had her companions laughing, and by
the time they had finished their preparations
the color had returned to their faces and each
had found her voice.</p>
<p>Mr. Disbrow was their first caller. He turned
Harriet toward the light that shone through the
tent opening and gazed quizzically down into
her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a wee bit nervous, eh? You will get
over that when you get to work. It is perfectly
natural. Everyone feels nervous before going
into a tournament. Why, when I am going into
a match I am so nervous that I can&rsquo;t talk without
breaking down, but the moment I feel the
grip of the racquet in my hand and see the net
before me I want to shout for joy. Ah, life is
worth while when you are facing a hard-hitter
across the net, and there leaps into your heart
a savage determination to drive him from the
court, a defeated man. Of course, it doesn&rsquo;t always
work out that way. Sometimes you are
the fellow who gets driven off, but it is the spirit,
almost as much as the skill, that wins games.
No one with a faint heart ever won anything
except defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you theen that beautiful cup thith
morning?&rdquo; questioned Tommy eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I did not come over that way,&rdquo; answered
P. E. laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it ith thtill there,&rdquo; was the little girl&rsquo;s
anxious remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may depend upon it. Later in the day
it will be brought over to the grounds so that it
may serve as an encouragement to the contestants.
Don&rsquo;t lose yourself gazing at it while you
are playing,&rdquo; he warned jokingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the other teams?&rdquo; asked the
guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are thick as flies on a summer&rsquo;s
day. They are literally swarming about the
place. But there will be a thinning out soon. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
was not misinformed regarding the Scott Sisters.
They are fine championship material.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; demanded Harriet quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, in about two hourth from now,&rdquo; answered
Tommy. &ldquo;But I do withh I wath not
tho weak in my kneeth. Why, do you think, am I
tho weak in my kneeth, Mr. Dithbrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imagine that. Forget all about it.
Think of the beautiful cup and the weakness will
leave your knees,&rdquo; he advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, I have notithed that. I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to go out,&rdquo; called George cheerily,
poking his head into the tent. &ldquo;All fit and fine,
I see. There&rsquo;s going to be some lively work
pretty soon. Jack Herrington says this is going
to be a rattling tournament. You know where
your courts are. Now go in and win. Good
luck to the Meadow-Brook Girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to,&rdquo; answered Harriet Burrell,
but her voice, though having lost none of its
determination, seemed rather weak to Captain
Baker.</p>
<p>Already the teams were taking their places in
their respective courts and an air of tense expectancy
was beginning to be noticeable over the
great throng of spectators. It was all confusion
to the girls. They did not appear to see
any one individually, and in their ears was that
confused murmur that they had heard while in
their tent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>George led Jane and Hazel to their respective
courts, Miss Elting and Disbrow accompanying
them at a short distance behind. The trim figures
of the Meadow-Brook Girls clad in their
dark blue serge uniforms attracted no little
attention as the two stepped into the courts
where they were to play. Pressing close against
the ropes, anxiously twirling their hats in their
hands, were the boys of the Tramp Club, so nervous
that they could scarcely control themselves.
Harriet and Tommy also came out to
watch this first match of their companions.</p>
<p>The linesmen were in their places at the sides
of the courts, the referee sat in his high chair,
where he commanded a clear view of the court
over which he was to make decisions. Tommy
laughed and poked Harriet in the ribs with her
racquet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doethn&rsquo;t he look funny in hith high chair?&rdquo;
she chuckled. &ldquo;Jutht like a baby. They ought
to give him a bib and tucker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh-h-h-h!&rdquo; The referee was instructing the
players as to what was expected of them. This
finished, the sides tossed for the courts and service.
In the case of the Meadow-Brook team
the toss was won by their opponents, giving the
opponents the service, the right to serve the first
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
ball, a considerable advantage and one that frequently
leads to victory.</p>
<p>The team opposed to Hazel and Jane were
Miss Sprague and Miss Collins, the famous Riversides.
Each girl was larger than either Hazel
or her teammate, but to Disbrow&rsquo;s keen eyes the
two Riverside girls did not appear to be in the
fittest condition. They were a little too stout,
it seemed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play!&rdquo; called the referee.</p>
<p>Jane and Hazel stood in position, Jane apparently
all ready to return the first ball that went
over the net. Disbrow uttered a sigh of relief
as he saw the lack of force with which Miss
Sprague served the ball. Surely his pupil would
send it back in the approved &ldquo;smashing&rdquo; manner.
But Jane stood as if rooted to the spot;
her first experience of playing before a crowd of
onlookers had given her an unprecedented attack
of &ldquo;stage fright.&rdquo; She partially recovered
when the ball was on its second bounce, but then
it was too late, for the Meadow-Brooks had lost
the first point. And so it was throughout the six
games that followed. Both Hazel and Jane
played more like wooden automatons than like
the strong, agile girls they were known to be.
Their opponents were weak players, but they
had entered tournaments before and therefore
had more self-confidence than the Meadow-Brook
Girls. In nearly every game either Jane
or Hazel would manage to get a point or two,
but Miss Sprague and her partner succeeded in
getting six games before Disbrow&rsquo;s pupils had
won any, and therefore were credited with the
first set of the match.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>The Tramp Boys had cheered the girls whenever
they had the slightest excuse, but they
were too despondent to offer any real encouragement
to the defeated teammates as they made
their weary way to the dressing tent for a seven
minutes&rsquo; rest. Even Disbrow could not conceal
his disappointment, for he knew the Meadow-Brook
team had not played as well as they had
done in practice. Jane realized this, too, and
just before they reached the court for the second
set she whispered to Hazel in a very decided
tone, &ldquo;This set we <i>must</i> win. You know
perfectly well that we can play better than those
girls. If we lose, it will be a disgrace to Mr.
Disbrow, and if we make use of all he has so
patiently taught us, we shall not lose. Come
on, let&rsquo;s &lsquo;thhow&rsquo; him, as Tommy would say.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>The next set told a very different story. Miss
Collins and Miss Sprague had become over-confident
because they had won the first set so
easily; the Meadow-Brook spirit had asserted
itself once more, with the result that Jane and
Hazel had three games to their credit almost before
they knew it. The Tramp Boys were yelling
with delight, but the Englishman&rsquo;s team
were so intent on the business at hand that they
were hardly conscious of the din. The second
set they won easily, the final score being 6-2 in
their favor. In the third decisive set of the
match every point marked a long struggle, and
the Riversides had to fight for every point they
gained. The games stood 5-2 in their favor
when Jane caught sight of Disbrow&rsquo;s tense, excited
face and tightly clasped hands. That was
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember P. E.,&rdquo; she whispered to Hazel,
and thereafter they played with such vim that
they brought the score up to 5-5 or deuce. Wild
yells from onlookers greeted this feat. However,
the longer training and greater poise of
the Riversides told in the end, for in their eagerness
to return one of the balls, Jane and Hazel
both rushed for it, collided in the middle of the
court, and the ball passed swiftly by them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Game and set for the Riversides!&rdquo; called
out the referee.</p>
<p>Recovering quickly from their collision, Hazel
and Jane jumped gracefully over the net and
shook hands with their opponents, almost before
any one realized that the match was over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>When the Meadow-Brook Girls made their
way back to the tent this time they heard congratulations
for their plucky playing on all
sides, and friendly sympathy for their bad luck.
Disbrow was delighted with the showing they
had made, and as he had not expected them to
win, he was really proud of his team.</p>
<p>While Jane and Hazel had been playing, the
Fifth Avenues were giving a fine exhibition of
their skill in a preliminary match. Harriet and
Tommy watched with great interest, for they
were to play the winners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Game and set for the Fifth Avenues,&rdquo; announced
the referee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fifteen minutes the &lsquo;running up&rsquo; matches
will be played, the Scott Sisters <i>vs.</i> The Riversides,
and the Fifth Avenues <i>vs.</i> The Meadow-Brooks,&rdquo;
Mr. Herrington then announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means you and me, Tommy,&rdquo; whispered
Harriet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, I know it doeth. But what did he
mean by the &lsquo;running up&rsquo; matches&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Disbrow explained that to me a few
minutes ago. The two teams that win these
matches play against each other for the cup.
Therefore, those three teams and we are &lsquo;running
up&rsquo; for the cup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we are going to win it, too, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, we are, for the sake of P. E. and the
Tramp Boys, if not for our own,&rdquo; Harriet declared
as they made their way to the court.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic4">

<p class="center"><i>&ldquo;We are Going to Win,&rdquo; Declared Harriet.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Play!&rdquo; called the referee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; asked the Fifth Avenue
girl who had won the right to serve the first ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Harriet.</p>
<p>Harriet being the striker-out, it was her duty
first to permit the ball to strike the ground, taking
it on its first bound and return it into the
opposite court. The service ball had been
served with great swiftness, it seemed, whereas,
as a matter of fact, it was not coming nearly as
fast as Harriet had thought. The ball dropped
into her court not far from the net. Harriet
saw at once that she had misjudged the serve
and that she must make a quick move.</p>
<p>She ran quickly and leaning slightly forward
started to scoop the ball up and return it, when
suddenly both feet slipped out from under her.
Harriet measured her full length on the ground,
falling flat on her face, sliding along the slippery
court until she plunged head-first into the net.</p>
<p>A shout went up from the spectators. The
Tramp Boys groaned. They wished themselves
miles away. Miss Elting&rsquo;s face grew suddenly
pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen-love,&rdquo; droned the referee. Harriet&rsquo;s
opponent had scored the first point. Harriet
got up. She was covered with brown mud
from head to feet, a good bit of it on her face.
Never had she suffered the humiliation that
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
was hers at that moment. Tommy had not uttered
a sound. She was aghast with amazement.</p>
<p>The play went on, but not a point had been
scored by Harriet and her partner when the announcement
fell from the lips of the referee:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it awful!&rdquo; groaned Sam Crocker.</p>
<p>The second game was a repetition of the first
except that Harriet did not fall down. It was
a love game in favor of their opponents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; declared Dill when they began
the third game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our last chance, Tommy. We <i>must</i> win
the rest of the set. See! They&rsquo;ve brought the
cup here,&rdquo; said Harriet.</p>
<p>The cup stood out in the bright sunlight a
vivid flame. Tommy gasped. It was an inspiration
to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth,&rdquo; she breathed in awe of the beautiful
sight.</p>
<p>They began to play. Harriet Burrell did not
fall down. She was on her mettle. All the determination
that she possessed had been summoned
to the task before her. She was a different
person. Tommy, inspired by the sight of
the beautiful trophy, was a different girl, too.</p>
<p>Their opponents won the first two games, but
Harriet and Tommy gave evidence of their
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
splendid training and spirit by winning the next
two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two-all,&rdquo; called the referee, and so the score
went see-sawing back and forth until it was
deuce, and finally 6-5 in favor of the Meadow-Brooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive them out,&rdquo; urged Harriet. She returned
the server&rsquo;s stroke, putting the ball into
her opponents&rsquo; court, where neither of them succeeded
in hitting it.</p>
<p>The decisive game now stood forty-thirty,
leaving the Meadow-Brook team but one point
to go. This Harriet made by a puzzling
&ldquo;floater,&rdquo; a slow ball that fell in the opposite
court far out of reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Game!&rdquo; announced the referee. &ldquo;Seven
minutes&rsquo; rest at the end of third.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the Tramp Boys were silent.
They were scarcely able to believe their eyes.
Then the boys tossed their hats in the air and
uttered a great shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried Disbrow. &ldquo;Keep on that
way and you will win the match. If you do, it
will have been a magnificent thing after the awful
start you made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Elting&rsquo;s eyes were shining happily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls, do you know who the Scott Sisters
are?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t imagine! Your
opponents are Patricia Scott and her sister!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; was Harriet&rsquo;s sharp exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the same Patricia Scott who was dismissed
from Camp Wau-Wau because of her enmity
for you and her disgraceful treatment of
you. She saw you girls, too. She knows all
about our being entered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet and Jane glanced at each other.
There was the same thought in the mind of
each. Patricia, or her friends, had had something
to do with the cutting of the tent ropes.
But neither girl voiced her suspicion at the moment.
They were called back to the court almost
immediately. But in Harriet Burrell&rsquo;s
mind was a stronger determination than ever to
win until she came face to face with Patricia
Scott across the tennis net, provided Patricia
were still playing, which seemed more than
likely, for the Scott Sisters were playing a magnificent
game.</p>
<p>The story of the next set of the match is
briefly told. Harriet and Tommy played three
strong games, not perfect games by any manner
of means, but Disbrow, who was watching
their every movement with the eyes of an expert,
saw that they were coming up magnificently.
Each succeeding game was played better
than the previous one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set and match for the Meadow-Brook
Girls,&rdquo; called the referee, in stentorian tones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>The Tramp Boys were beside themselves with
joy. Regardless of time or place, they uttered
a series of blood-curdling war whoops.</p>
<p>But there was little time for congratulation.
The Scott Sisters had won their match, and
therefore would be pitted against Harriet and
Tommy in the final match of the tournament.
Fifteen minutes were allowed each team to recuperate.</p>
<p>The Tramp Boys were becoming worked up
to a pitch of enthusiasm that threatened the
temporary loss of their reason. Sam suddenly
made a discovery. A young man in a white suit
was seen talking with the Scott Sisters. There
was something very familiar about his appearance.
Sam drew near. When the man left the
two girls, Sam followed him until the young
man reached a secluded place at the end of the
grand stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the fellow who hit me on the nose!&rdquo;
he hissed. &ldquo;Put up your hands! I am going to
pay my debts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Samuel Crocker had finished with the
stranger the white suit was sadly stained with
mud, and the young man&rsquo;s own nose was in
need of repairs. The fellow fled from the field,
while Sam returned triumphantly to his companions,
one eye blackened, his hair standing
up, but his heart full of unholy joy. He felt
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
that he had wiped out two scores instead of
one.</p>
<p>The ranks of the players were thinning. It
was well along in the afternoon now. Players
moved about wearily. Their feet were not
nearly so light as when the work of the day had
begun and there were many disappointed faces
to be seen. As for the Meadow-Brook Girls, instead
of growing weary, they plainly were gaining
in strength. Perhaps their success was
largely responsible for this. But their endurance
was undeniable. Still, the work of the
day was far from done, the championship a long
way off, for the team that had been picked to win
were still to be beaten.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm was running high. The Meadow-Brook
Girls had by this time become very prominent.
They were nearing the blazing cup which
had served as Tommy&rsquo;s inspiration and which
seemed almost within reach now. But there remained
the other team, before which everything
had gone down. It seemed hopeless for Harriet
and her slender, excitable little companion to
hope to win against the hard-hitting, quick-footed,
skilful Scott Sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; declared Disbrow. &ldquo;But
even if they do not, they have won second place.
That alone I should think ought to be triumph
enough for any team that has been on the court
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
only five weeks. Oh, this is splendid! It&rsquo;s glorious!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harriet overheard. Her eyes lighted up for
a moment and, catching Mr. Disbrow&rsquo;s eyes, she
smiled. Then, nudging Tommy, she moved toward
the center court, where the final game was
to be played. Only Tommy, Harriet and the
Scott Sisters were left now. All the other courts
were deserted with the exception of number five,
on which a series of consolation games were to
be played by the losers. But there was little interest
in these. The great and absorbing interest
was for number one court. The two teams
were loudly cheered when they appeared at the
court where the finals were to be played.</p>
<p>The Scott girls, smiling, confident, but plainly
weary from the hard-fought battles of the day,
entered the court. Patricia Scott jeered audibly
as Harriet entered the opposite court and
faced her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry we couldn&rsquo;t have met you earlier
in the day,&rdquo; she said sneeringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I share your regret,&rdquo; answered Harriet
calmly. &ldquo;But better late than never. I am
going to defeat you if I can, Patricia, and I
think I can. If you win this match you will
earn it, and so shall we if we win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Patricia tossed her head in the air and stepped
back, an angry light in her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some bad blood there,&rdquo; said a spectator who
had overheard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady,&rdquo; warned the voice of Mr. Disbrow
from the side lines.</p>
<p>Harriet nodded, but did not turn her head.
She was watching her opponents, studying their
every move, planning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play!&rdquo; commanded the referee.</p>
<p>Then began the game that was to be talked
of for many a day thereafter by those who had
been fortunate enough to watch it.</p>
<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><span class="small">CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>Patricia served. Tommy returned it,
whereupon Patricia sent a ball which
Tommy failed to reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen love,&rdquo; announced the referee. The
Scott Sisters had won the first point easily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look alive!&rdquo; snapped Harriet, cutting her
words off short. &ldquo;Keep the cup in mind, but
don&rsquo;t look at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scott Sisters took another point; then the
tide changed. The Meadow-Brook Girls made
two points in succession. The score stood
at thirty-all. Then the latter gave a point to
their opponents by a winning cross-court volley
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
made by Patricia&rsquo;s sister. Harriet earned the
next point for the Meadow-Brooks by driving
a terrific ball straight at Patricia Scott. The
ball hit her squarely on the left eye, bounded
back and came to rest in her court before she
realized what had occurred. The spectators
uttered a shout.</p>
<p>The two teams were tied at deuce. Harriet
began speeding up, but took two long chances
and faulted two points to her opponents. The
Scott Sisters had won the first game of the set,
but there had been no lack of excitement. They
had secured the necessary two points after the
score had stood at deuce, or three points each.</p>
<p>Excitement ran high. There could be no
doubt that here were two <i>real</i> teams. About
this time the word began to be passed about
that the Meadow-Brook Girls had never played
a real game of tennis up to about five weeks before
the tournament. It was inconceivable. But
by the time the Scott Sisters had won the first
set, Tommy was showing a little weariness and
welcomed the seven minutes&rsquo; rest granted to
both teams.</p>
<p>Encouraged by Mr. Disbrow, and still determined
to have the cup, the Meadow-Brooks won
the second set after a bitter fight. They walked
briskly to their tent amid the cheers and shouts
of the spectators. In the tent they were fanned,
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
their faces bathed, their mouths rinsed with
water&mdash;they were not permitted to drink&mdash;then
once more they were called forth to what all
believed was to be a great battle. If anything,
Harriet Burrell was fresher, stronger than
at any time since she had begun playing in the
tournament, but it was too much to hope that
she and Tommy could ever stand up under the
cruel grilling of the Scott Sisters, who seemed
to know every trick that was known to tennis
players. Tommy and Harriet would do well to
earn second place.</p>
<p>P. Earlington Disbrow&rsquo;s face was pale, his
hair was rumpled, his fingers were open and
closing nervously, while little beads of perspiration
stood out on his forehead.</p>
<p>The next set was a fight from start to finish.
The Meadow-Brooks went at it aggressively.
They hammered the Scott Sisters, giving them
such a grilling as those two players had never
experienced. Twice during the one game Patricia
had been made a target for Harriet&rsquo;s ball,
twice had Patricia been struck in the face, unable
to dodge in time to avoid, or to hit the ball
the way it came to her. She appealed angrily
to the referee, only to be informed that if she
could not keep out of the way of the ball she
must expect to be hit. As a point was scored
for her opponent each time the ball touched her
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
person or her clothing, Patricia naturally was
angry.</p>
<p>The Scott Sisters threw themselves savagely
into their work. Some time since they had
learned the Meadow-Brook code of signals, as
Harriet quickly discovered. The code was abandoned
then and there, but as she played Harriet
was devising a new scheme for outwitting
their opponents. Then to Harriet&rsquo;s dismay she
discovered that Tommy was giving out. Little
Tommy seemed to be withering. She was making
a desperate effort to hide her utter weariness,
but the quick eyes of their opponents discovered
this fact very shortly after Harriet had
done so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Favor yourself. I&rsquo;ll take the bulk of the
work,&rdquo; flashed Harriet, when near enough to
speak without being overheard. The opposition
having observed that the little lisping girl was
weakening began to hammer her, volleying at
her, hurling ground balls into her court, directing
almost their full attack at her.</p>
<p>Harriet, in making a run to her companion&rsquo;s
assistance, slipped, fell, but was on her feet almost
instantly. Miss Elting saw the girl twist
her face as if she were suffering great pain.
Harriet limped a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that <i>settles</i> it!&rdquo; groaned Disbrow.</p>
<p>But it was not settled yet. Game after game
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
was played, first one side getting the odd game
then the other, and at every other game the
score went from advantage to deuce and back
again. It was well-nigh impossible to get the
two games necessary to give the set to one side
or the other. The day was waning. Harriet
Burrell and Tommy Thompson had been on the
courts for hours. Their opponents also had
been playing fully as long, but they were large
and strong, while one of the Meadow-Brook
partners was slight and was fast becoming exhausted.</p>
<p>Harriet, by taking all of her partner&rsquo;s work
that she possibly could, gave Tommy a little
rest. The latter finally announced that she felt
strong enough to take her full share of the play.
It was then that Harriet tried the new plans she
had been thinking out. She had observed in all
the playing that players always glanced quickly
in the direction they proposed to send the ball.
This had been a great help to her in deciding
where an opponent&rsquo;s ball was going. She tried
the plan of looking in the opposite direction just
before she served a ball. The effect exceeded
her fondest expectations. The striker-out
leaped the wrong way the first time the trick was
turned on her and Harriet scored a point. From
that on the trick was applied now and then and
almost always with success. Harriet&rsquo;s lips were
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
set tight all the time she played and it was plain
to those who knew her well that she was suffering
great pain, but from what they did not know.</p>
<p>The Scott Sisters were furious. Where they
had confidently looked for an easy victory, they
found themselves fighting the greatest battle of
their lives. Three times they had been warned
by the referee for violations of the law, and,
had the Meadow-Brook Girls demanded it, the
game, under these circumstances, would have
gone to them. They made no such demand.
They proposed to fight it out to the bitter end.
It was deuce, then advantage, advantage, then
deuce again and again. Would there be no end
to it? Each side determined that the next game
should put an end to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid Miss Thompson is too far gone
for our wonderful girls to win. But oh, what a
magnificent battle!&rdquo; cried Mr. Disbrow. Captain
Baker opened his mouth to reply, but was
too overcome with emotion to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy, <i>we must win this game</i>! Understand?&rdquo;
whispered Harriet.</p>
<p>Grace nodded weakly. They were advantage-in
on games, being one game in the lead. It now
needed but a game to win the match for them,
but it had needed but one game to do that several
times during this grilling battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You play close to the net on your side. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
will cover the court. If they lob, I will try to get
out in time to volley it back. Now do your best.
Remember the cup! Remember the beautiful
cup, Tommy,&rdquo; encouraged Harriet.</p>
<p>Tommy looked toward the cup, now turned to
molten gold under the last rays of the departing
sun. Tommy uttered a little squeal and leaped
up into the air to meet a lob from her opponent,
which she did so successfully that she scored for
her team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl!&rdquo; encouraged Harriet. &ldquo;Keep
them at the back of the&mdash;oh, that was too bad,&rdquo;
as Patricia scored a point. The score in that
game now stood thirty-fifteen. The Scott Sisters
gained another point over Tommy&rsquo;s fault,
making the score thirty-all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow ball over the net,&rdquo; commanded Harriet.
Tommy obeyed and Tommy scored. Patricia
volleyed, then darted back near the baseline
ready to take a hard volley which she expected
in return from Harriet, who was going
to make the return, or to run up in case of a
drop-ball.</p>
<p>Harriet saw it all. It was a critical moment.
Her plans were formed in a second&rsquo;s time. She
sent a floater toward her opponent&rsquo;s court. It
hit the net-band, the strip of white canvas on
the upper edge of the net. Patricia had darted
forward just as Harriet knew she would, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
as the ball hit the net-band, Patricia stopped
short and laughed. She thought the ball had
been played into the net and that it would fall
back into her opponent&rsquo;s court, thus scoring a
point for the Scott team.</p>
<p>Instead of doing so the tennis ball, after striking
the net-band, hopped over the net and dropped
into Patricia Scott&rsquo;s court, rolled along a
few feet toward the side-line and stopped. It
was as neat a &ldquo;net ball&rdquo; as any expert there had
ever seen played.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Game!&rdquo; announced the referee. &ldquo;The
Meadow-Brook team wins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all. For a few seconds there was
silence. The sun flashed out of sight and the
cup changed from gold to silver. Harriet limped
toward the net.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you shake hands with me, Patricia?&rdquo;
she asked, with a wan smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because I have to.&rdquo; Patricia&rsquo;s voice
was low, and only Harriet heard her add, &ldquo;I
hate you more than ever!&rdquo; With that she hurried
off the court.</p>
<p>It seemed that up to that moment the spectators
had not realized that the game was over.
Now it came to them with tremendous force.</p>
<p>The little serge-clad Meadow-Brook Girls, the
girls who had had but five weeks&rsquo; practice on the
tennis court, had won one of the greatest amateur
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
matches that had ever been played on the
Atlantic coast. A great, explosive roar burst
from the throats of the spectators.</p>
<p>P. Earlington Disbrow, forgetting that his
sprained ankle was no longer sprained, began
hopping about like a rabbit. The boys fought
their way through the throngs that were almost
mobbing them to get at the victorious girls. They
got them safely to the dressing tent, but as soon
as they were inside Harriet&rsquo;s head had drooped
and she leaned heavily on Captain Baker&rsquo;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fainted,&rdquo; said George as they gently
laid her down on a cot in the dressing tent. Miss
Elting and a pale-faced woman rushed into the
tent at this juncture. The latter threw herself
down by the cot and gathered Harriet into her
arms. Tommy sat gasping on the floor while a
girl in a white sweater was bathing her face
with cold water.</p>
<p>Harriet suddenly opened her eyes and looked
into the face of the woman who was holding her
so tightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, O, Mother! is it you?&rdquo; she
breathed, with a sharp catch in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fainted, but you are all right now. Oh,
it was wonderful, but it was terrible,&rdquo; sobbed
Mrs. Burrell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was foolish in me to faint,&rdquo; answered
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
Harriet weakly. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have fainted, but
I sprained my ankle more than an hour ago. It
seemed as if every step I took would kill me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disbrow, with face now flushed, had been
standing on one leg peering anxiously in at Harriet
and her friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear, P. E.?&rdquo; shouted George, rushing
to him and shaking a fist under Disbrow&rsquo;s
nose. &ldquo;Do you hear that? She&rsquo;s been playing
on a sprained ankle for more than an hour, and
yet they won the cup! <i>They won the cup!</i>
Lucky for me that my heart&rsquo;s all right!
Whoope-e-e!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Word of this was quickly passed, and the people
would not leave until they had seen Harriet.
She was carried out&mdash;the boys would not permit
her to step even on one foot&mdash;then as she slipped
an arm about Tommy&rsquo;s neck and smiled
bravely, another great shout went up. But now
Jack Herrington was pushing his way to them.
In his hands he held the trophy they had won,
the much-coveted silver cup. He held up his
hand for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my pleasure,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to present this
handsome trophy to the Meadow-Brook Girls.
It has been fairly won, and that after the most
wonderful exhibition of pluck and endurance
that it ever has been my good fortune to witness.
I congratulate you from my heart. I am
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
proud of you, proud of the honor that is mine,
and hope we may meet again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The outburst that followed drowned his concluding
words. It was at this moment that Jane
McCarthy came tearing up in her motor car,
scattering people to the right and to the left.
The Meadow-Brook Girls were going back to
their camp to spend the night, then on the morrow
they were going home, bearing the precious
trophy that Harriet and Tommy had won
for them. There was also a smaller cup that
had been awarded to Jane and Hazel, but the
big trophy was the prize that overshadowed everything
else.</p>
<p>Immediately on their return to camp Harriet&rsquo;s
ankle was dressed by Miss Elting, after
the guardian had satisfied herself that no bones
were broken. The faithful Tramp Club had
elected to remain on guard about the Meadow-Brook
camp that night. P. Earlington Disbrow
also remained with them and after supper both
camps gathered in front of the tent for a long,
happy evening. In spite of her sprained ankle
Harriet insisted on making one of the party.</p>
<p>Sam, who had been pursuing diligent inquiries
regarding the young man to whom he had
administered a well-merited beating, now informed
them that the spy was none other than
the brother of the Scott Sisters, thus verifying
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
the suspicion in the minds of Jane and Harriet
that Patricia Scott was responsible for the cutting
of their tent ropes. Jane cast a triumphant
glance toward Harriet while Sam was speaking,
but the almost imperceptible shake of Harriet&rsquo;s
head caused the impulsive Irish girl to remain
silent regarding Patricia&rsquo;s past misdeeds.</p>
<p>It was late before the Meadow-Brook Girls
said good night to the Tramp Club and went
into their tent and the boys stationed themselves
outside for their vigil.</p>
<p>A few minutes after the Meadow-Brook Girls
and their guardian had rolled up in their blankets
for the night Tommy mumbled sleepily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harriet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, little partner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget about that thilver polithh and
the cloth, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; promised Harriet. Five
minutes later Harriet, too, was wrapped in
sleep, and the round-faced moon smiled kindly
down on the tired but triumphant Meadow-Brook Girls.</p>
